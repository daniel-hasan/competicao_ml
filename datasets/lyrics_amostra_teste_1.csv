province town or county
I thought it would be great if somedy i could be a
Mountie
I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because taht's
part of the profession
But now I just sit on my horse and tell American tourists the
parliament's in session
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my
head in every parade
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending
my career in Motorcades
CHORUS
I wanna enforce the law, I wanna wear normal clothes
I don't wanna have to smile for diplomat's home videos
I'm good at workin' real hard, I should have joined the Coast
Gaurd
Oh no the RCMP, is not the life for me
I used to think that a Mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble
strong and thrifty
But even though we don't break ranks we get no thanks, they
took us off the fifty (dollar bill)
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like gaurds in
shopping malls, it's such a pain
Like someone's plotting to kill the minister of
Sports and Recreation now that's insane
Sometimes I just wanna puke Sgt. Preston of the Yukon
Dudley Dooright's such a jerk
And though he tries with all his heart, my horse couldn't catch a
shopping cart
Somedays I hate to go to work

Where the end is always good and never sad.
Show me the way to another world
Where the sun is always shining in the and
And we fight back the tears, and we lose our fears,
Let the world remain in silence for a while
Sun in our minds in a world full of ice,
Let silence remain for a little while.
Somebody came and slammed the door,
took the feelin' away from our hearts.
And the horror took hold of a place
in our hearts filled with love.
What is left behind the ice,
behind the make up and the lies
Tell me what goes on inside our minds,
There is a hole in our sky,
getting bigger, growing wide
No more answer, but we hold the line
See and hear what we have done to us all,
we want to be free more than anything,
Do you hear what I say to you?
We will make it through, the sun shall shine.
Hear the words we say and see the light of day
We never will be free until the sun is shining for us all
Carry on, carry on and make our dreams come true
And for a little while we stay together
Carry on, carry on, may all our lovin' stay
And for a little while we stay together, forever

Their mittens as I was beginning to feel it soaking through my shoes,
Getting colder with every step I took to your apartment, dear.
And I was a kaleidoscope, the snow on my lenses distorting the image of what
Was only one of you and I didn't know which one to address as all your lips
Moved.
This is when I forget breathe all the things I scripted, they sound unfounded.
And the look that you're giving me, it tells me exactly what you are thinking,

I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain
Crying softly in her loveliness and pain
Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me
And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walking slowly how she'd never known a man
Living lonely in her cottage by the sea
When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping bout the secrets she was keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
In the morning as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leaving nothing but her silence next to me
And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walking slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearing in the silence of the sea
And I sometimes hear the echo of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find
For the answer I was seeking was the secrets she's still keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind"

You embody all that I've been through
Without you I am sure I will be loved
My existence conforms to your distress
Your ambition, the cause of mine
A disruption, I'm nothing, even less
Misfortunes never come singly and I was there to stay
You don't allow me a single place,
Nor any love into your lives
An unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
Where you used to be
Impotent screams will turn
Into the love of silence
My liberation, then silence,
Will be perfect and pure
It's all in my dreams,
I'll remove you
And all our mutual disgust
In my dreams,
I solve the problem by removing it
My wish is to see you grovel,
Like you once forced me to
There's no other way, here's my course of life
A path without the sickening trace of you
I need the beauty of a cleared, pure world
This eternal interruption of your rash life can save me
You don't allow me a single place,
Nor any love into your lives
An unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
It's sad to feel you don't believe in love,
It's sad that you're so cold
And I'll be the same,
If you keep on poisoning my life
Drowning in self-sacrificing visions
When you're gone, then we will all be released
It's sad my life has been like hell so far,
It's sad that you're the cause
And I'll be cured in this beautiful, empty world
Floating, floating away with your perilous visions and hate
When you're gone, silence will fill up the emptiness
When you're gone, we all will be released
In my dreams I shall rinse my body and soul
My wish,
The accomplishment lies here before me in my hands
I will be released from your accusing eyes
And torrents of verbal abuse

While life flows out of you

I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said I'll take two bottles of your best
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winkled as if to say you know the rest
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive I learned

I drove around the block till I was dizzy each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in

It's good to see you coming back again
It's been a long time
Since I sat with you, my friend
I'll lend an ear

Time has killed the pain
And dried up every tear
And now
I'm thinking 'bout what went down
All the heartache I laughed away
Just like a clown
And now sit around talking

I'm really glad you stopped in
To spend some time
You sit around talking
Thinking 'bout the past
It's funny how it lingers
But nothings meant to last
And my ma
She'd like to say hello
But she's a little scared
That I can't let it go
So let on, ease back, brother
And let it slip away
I'm tired of hanging onto
The pains of yesterday
And once again
The money is so thick
It makes your heart go numb
It makes your mind get sick
So come on by, stay and talk about it
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
Brother of mine
We'll sit around talking, drink some wine
And maybe by the morning
Everything is fine, everything is fine
Ease back, brother
Let this clear your mind
Come on by

Shadowless a figure stands
Stranded on venus sands
Up in the blue and circling
The seabirds watch and wait
For movement of a certain kind
Down on their dinner plate
Where children played
A flower lays
Pulled and torn up by its roots
And where it stood the empty space
Just screams...................................................................
Down on the flats baby turtles race
For safety of the big deep
And white caps come crashing in
Indifferent to tender flesh
Shriek of attack then moving in
A raucous clash a gourmet din
Of cruel gull beaks and tearing skin
Screaming...........................................................................

Against a blood orange sky
There's a shadow of a figure prone
Abandoned and all alone

Horrid scream, sinews are broken,

I made the best decisions molded on the way I survive.
And as the years go by I'm tested what I will be.
Will I stand the test of time, or will it make a better man of me.
I know what kind of man I can be,
I've let the simple things pass by and never let it get the best of me.
There's so many things I have seen and its never taken a piece from me.
Live life, find happiness and never look back on the life you were meant to lead.
Never look back.
I never wanted to live like this.
I never wanted to live this life alone.
I've made a path that I'll never forget.
Times are getting darker, because there's so much to do
And there's so little time to right the wrongs.
This is the life that I was meant to live.
There's not a thing I would change.
I'm vindicated and I swear I will make this worth my time.
And so the story continues I'm aware of what I've done, to many simple things have soiled all the things I believe.
And as the years go by I'm tested what I will be,
Will I stand the test of time or ill it make a better man of me.

Hang and blackout together

Laughing, wasting our time

In those basements made of music

Commences our saga
Two loved in silence
For fear of corruption
Then fate chimed in
With an evil grin and a mighty interruption
She awoke in a panic
The TV in static
She heard a voice
In the attic
Crouched behind her door
With a Swiss Army knife
She cried in silence
Fearing for her life
Protecting herself
She stabbed the intruder
The lights turned on
Her knife impaled her suitor
She'd committed a murder
While he laid there bleeding
She stared, clearly scared
Checked her boyfriend's heart for beating
It's not right

She cried through the morning
As she read the paper
Her father told police
The boy broke in to rape her
She ran to the bathroom
Enraged and pissed
Grabbed a razor
And tic-tac-toed her wrist

And while she laid there bleeding
She stared, clearly scared
Checked her final pulse for beating

My knees became weak and my heart started racing away
You left me breathless when I saw you heading my way
Holding you now well is all I can do to believe
If this isn't love baby don't wake me up from the dream
Cause baby you're turning and turning my world upside down
I should know better but there is no turning back now
And I never knew love to take so high
Take me to heaven and take me tonight
But whatever you do baby
Don't take your hands off my heart
The warmth of your touch is just too much for me to ignore
I've never know wanting you wanting me like this before
When all that's between you and I is the air that we breathe
The passion in you baby brings out the woman in me"

Where the word, like wildfire, spread.
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd
Left that stone in the river bed.
For they came like herds of locusts
Every woman, child and man
In their lumbering Conestogas
They left their tracks upon the land.
[Chorus]
Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.
Well, they came from New York City,
And they came from Alabam'
With their dreams of finding fortunes
In this wild unsettled land.
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
As they tried to cross the plains.
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains
With their hands froze to the reins.
Oh...
[Chorus]
Well, some pushed on to California
And others stopped to take their rest.
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty
They had opened up the west.
And then the railroad came behind them
And the land was plowed and tamed,
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,
He'd not one penny to his name.
Oh...

And some would curse John Sutter's Mill
Some men's thirsts are never filled."

Of what it'd be like to rock a crowd
And making my mom and daddy proud
I remember the day I slowed it down
Articulating words pronounced
I'm bending it backwards here

Showing you people the passion's real
And now I think my asthma's cleared
I can breathe now
I can dream
I can be anything in the world I wanna be

People comin' and go, but then they pop like a garage
And it's just life changing, if you know what I've been sayin'
Rappin' with the guitars is just a miracle in the makin'
They say, left and right but I guess I'm going up
No matter what they say, the feelings just not enough
Toss the mic, forget the moment and get past the hype
See, music never dies
It has an afterlife
Look at me, look at me, yea, look at me now
Life is passin' by
I need another round

King of the dream
King of my hometown
You got one life to live
You better live it now"

Down a canyon dark and empty in a stale and dreary haze

Darkness waiting in her eyes, her gaze
Kissed by a fraudulent snake
A soul eater, serpent's embrace
Serpents embrace
She was the dawn of a new day
But all it brought was pure dismay
The sky and sun turned black
Nailed black as ebony
And there was no turning back
No turning back
A golden sun in past times, floating high above
Looking back from now, a collection of strange days, for love
And at time I realized
Everything must surely end, some day
Darkness waiting in her eyes
Darkness waiting in her gaze
She gave birth to a worm of lies
A place of shadows mourn
A soul eater, serpent's embrace
Every dawn of a new day
Too far away, but death in cheap
There's a giant, black sun below
Maybe just below the ground, about six feet deep
Beneath the undertow

I'm not name calling names alright, I'm just stating facts, the fact is you're a quivering pussy
I'm the pussy? Really? Well at least I don't play with toys still

Well at least I did my fucking job, I kept him working, I kept him productive
You were supposed to look after him
You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable for all this
Now you're trying to blame me for how he's feeling, how he's feeling!
If he's feeling unhappy it's because you failed him
You did this to him, he hates you I know he does, he fucking hates you!

No you're not
Look, maybe there's something we can do together
Together?
Take the best parts of both of us and put them together
It would let you let your feelings out, It would let me analyze
It's something that George Carlin did, It's something Steve Martin did
It's something special we can both perform, do you know what it is?

Not sleeping for a week and spun
The mother's thoughts swirls into darkness
She doesn't know what she's doing
The post-birth stress is unbearable
So she does the unthinkable
Grabbing her child by the throat
She throws it against the wall
Snapping it's delicate neck
But that's just the beginning
She doesn't know when to stop
Repeatedly, she punches and kicks
She killed her baby
The red fluid starts to flow
Though already dead, she continues
Stabbing away at the infant with her bare hands
Skin and muscle thrown about the room
Lifeless, headless skeletal infant sitting in her hands
She passes out
Then wakes two days later
Seeing what she's done
She deservingly takes her life
And the ties
Between flesh and blood
Is now a
Another victim to be murdered"

As my politics begin to roll
Things are getting out of control
It's time to stop, drop and rock 'n' roll
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
Glued to the tube TV before Dallas 1963
It was assumed baby boomers
Bloomed doomed to ruin the country
But who knew the children of Normandy
Soon would resume war with Vietnamese
Overseas, we sent 18 year-olds to bleed
Face it, like Oswald woke the nation
Osama woke my generation
Now the kids of Nintendo
If drafted will attend the
Bush administration family agenda
Of bending back hands and sending children
Attacking Iraqi lands and buildings
So Cheney can rebuild for 200 billion
They'll disarm the regime but not the children
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
Sacrificing our kids lives for global crisis
While fools of the NRA
Watch kids shoot kids in high schools
With tools they say kill deer
Not fill pools of blood
And guts, and tears, and the love and trust
We lent to the government
That's here to protect not just guns but us
Don't place blame on video games
Marilyn Manson or NWA
How can we blame them for the situation?
When an Alzheimer's patient
Leads the Nation Rifle Association
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
I'm a Reagan Baby
My formative years are the 1980s
Russian production and reduction
Of weapons of mass destruction
Happened already
Even the Cuban missile crisis
Had pictures of bombs throughout the island
To sway bias
And now we hide behind bombs
Dropped on innocent moms
Ignoring gun control and dropping stocks
Senate majority leaders opposing '57 Little Rock
While we annihilate North Korea, Iran and Iraq
If the government shoots first
To stimulate commerce
Things are only going to get worse
If the government shoots first
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
We sold them the same guns
That are now facing back towards us
And what do we do?
We go over there
But until we view here and there as the same place
We will always be fighting another religion, another race
There are peaceful solutions
There are peaceful resolutions
Peace"

I tried my best to stop them, yes, I tried to make them wait
And I appealed to their decency show mercy on this day
I issued them strong orders on pain of death and disarray
But in the end they would not listen and raised their lances anyway
Men of no account they were, their breeding crude and low
With not a trace of wisdom, Grace or virtue in their souls
Yet trained them long and hard I did to bend them to the crown
To act as tools of justice, follow edict handed down
You see these were not militia men, a-fighting for their homes
Nor fathers, sons nor husbands, sire, but foreigners on loan
Mercenary killers, career soldiers to a man
Lashing out with vengeance one cannot accept or understand
I could not instill the discipline 'twas duty to inspire
And they responded in the end to instincts of the basest kind
Now on my knee before you here, I drop my eyes in shame
Albeit little consolation take my head for I'm to blame
O, so spoke the leader on losing control"

Slowly, gently, night unfurls it's splendor. Grasp it, sence it, tremulous and tendor. Turn your face away from the garish light of day. Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light and listen to the music of the night.
Close your eyes and serendor to your darkest dreams, perge all thoughts of the life you knew before. Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar. And you'll live as you've never lived before.
Softly, deaftly, music shall caress you. Hear it, feel it, secretly posess you. Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you can not fight, the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world. Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before. Let your soul take you where you long to be, only then, can you belong to me.
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication. Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation. Let the dream begin, let your darkest side give in, to the power of the music that I write. The power of the music of the night.
You alone can make my song take flight. Help me make the music of the night."

Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away
They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion
Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves.

Frustrated lives.

It's a day that has been contantly repeated for years and years
A day no more or less significant than any other day
It's only a blur in the endless carnage and suffering
That possesses the stinging similarity to the Nazi holocaust
These atrocities, however, are happening right now
It's just another day of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia
Ethnic cleansing is the Serbian invented euphemism
Describing the atrocities being committed against Muslim and Croatian civilians
The war that began in April 1992 was predictable
What was not so predictable was the cold-blooded murder of civilians,
Nor was the massive deportation in over crowded cattle cars
Of trains to concentration camps
Upon arrival at these camps prisoners are sheared like sheep
Denied medical attention, food and shelter many die in these camps every day
The grass has all been ripped out to eat
When it rains prisoners find themselves standing up to their knees in mud
Only a handful of these prisoners bore arms against the Serbian soldiers
The Serbian government has given orders that special treatment be shown
To healthy women between seventeen and forty years of age
Tens of thousands of these young girls and women receiving this special treatment
Were systematically raped with the sickening plan of impregnating them with Serbian seeds
And making them bare a stranger, which is then to be taken away
The world strongly stated ""Never Again"" after World War II
This may be the reason why most of the world seems to be ignoring this modern day genocide
Tuesday May 18th, 1993 ws the date on the newspaper that held the gruesome picture of
A woman holding a skull that once belonged to a loved one
This single picture outraged me and opened my eyes to the ethnic cleansing
I had previously overlooked as just another war?
It was a slap in the face that I still feel to this day
A constant reminder of the pain caused by human ignorance and greed
Almost two years and one song later and nothing's changed, except for the death toll
How muchlonger will the people sit silently by... as history repeats?"

And what were we supposed to do?
You belong to me and what are we supposed to do?
Suck it in, spit it out
You know that two's a crowd?
Expectant mother's stillborn baby beauty
Cries aloud and tries
To tell you what I'm about
Now don't you worry
About a little thing like this
It only hurts just a bit I promise
I'm going to take you a mile high so don't you cry
Cause it'll just be baby, baby, baby nonstop
Until the end of the night
So keep your mouth shut
I can tell you're a good fuck
Just by the way you wear that innocent look
Don't you know that enough is never enough
I made you
Now you are property I can't discard"

It's over, end of the line
It's over and your doin' fine
It's over and over and over, I'm asking why
You're leaving it's over now
Gone are the love songs that only we knew
Robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through
Gone is the sweet love, tried but untrue
It's over all over now
It's over, end of the line
It's over and my desperate heart is still trying to find some way,
Hoping you'll stay

The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go runnin' through my mind, I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard

I told her that I loved her true

Said a man like you don't get too far

Was Back in Black racing through my veins, last thing I thought
Was a flip in this thing gonna get me killed.
I'm pretty sure my old man will.
And seeing his face when the wrecker hauled my freedom away
That's how I learned to pray.
It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say.
I was living like I was (?), mama always said
It'd take a special girl to get a hold of me,
But I never let one get close to me.
The man upstairs must've heard her prayer,
Cause I looked up, you were standin' there waitin' on me
Like you were made for me.
And I knew right then and there, I'd been saved
And that's how I learned to pray.
It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say.
I can fold my hands and bow my head,
But there's just some things that can't be said
Without a little walk on water kind of faith.
And that's how I learned to pray.
Have you ever looked up at the stars in the sky, felt a tug at your heart
Didn't know why but you just knew
Someone is up there lookin' out for you.
Well you know just what I mean when I say Grace.
That's how I learned to pray.
That's how I learned to pray."

By seminal odours no longer hidden by dignity
And purified by their beaks rummaging her swollen vagina

All I had goin` is gone
The best I'll ever do
Is over and done
It serves me right
'Cause I did her wrong
Now all I had goin` is gone
Sometimes a man
Just don't understand
He possesses everything life can bring
He thinks there's more
So he has to explore
Leavin` her alone
Time after time
Til she wlaked out my door
Now it serves me right
She left me alone
Now all I had goin` is gone"

The DJ's took pills to stay awake

They went to the studio
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party
and played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun
and walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a rag
and smiling cooly drove away
He's rich. Got a big car.
My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seduction in cars, abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust

Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair.

The path that leads you back is there all the time
No doors have been shut to keep you outside
Benevolent skies will lead the way

Losing our sight of the goal,
we runaround in our worlds of our own.
We runaround in our mazes alone.

We runaround...
Taking it all in
For each breath I give I'm closing in

I would like to be close to your heart

In the belly of a black-winged bird
Don't try to feed me
I've been here before and I deserve a little more
I belong in the service of the Queen I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying I've been thinking And I am the Rain King
Mama, why am I so alone?
I can't go outside
I'm scared I might not make it home
I'm alive but I'm sinking in
If there's anyone at home at your place
Why don't you invite me in
Don't try to bleed me
I've been there before and I deserve a little more
I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been lying
I've been sinking
And I am the Rain King
Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends
After all the dreaming I come home again...
When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)
I think of dying Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged
bird
Don't try to bleed me
I've been here before and I deserve a little more
I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been dying

Of lights and bulbs and popcorn strings, tangled in a knot
Then I spend the day separating what I've got

I started writing letters now I just say ""best regards""
I shove 'em in a mailbox and to the mall I go
To get gifts for Jim and Jane and Tim and Uncle Joe (and aunt Mavis and Grandma and

Two days till Christmas, a million things to do
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due
Where are my in-laws, they should have shown up
I bet they're at the airport I forgot to pick them up

The strength I need is now flowing away
The choking feeling obstructs everything
So erratic in search for the truth
The pain is strong and persists
Silence was just a diversion to come out on the hard truth again
Leaving this world of illusions seen through the eyes of the innocent
Confronted with the infinity of chaos, forcing you to rearrange
When your litanies are unheard
Phantasm becomes coldly real
There's a thin line between the world of illusion and reality

And a short few words later it all just comes untied?
You can't believe you're looking at what was always someone else
Now it's staring right back at you, yesterday you couldn't tell
So shock and disillusioned, helpless and confused
Not knowing how and what to say, not accepting that it's true.
You can't help but see the worst to come a thousand different ways
The same time trying to hold a strong and optimistic gaze.
When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.
And the angry starts to surface, looking up, asking why
Then you realize he probably wants the best, as same as I
Days just go by quickly, nights just never end
As time gets so more precious, every sunrise and old friend
Trying to be a post to lean on, a part you learn is hard to play
Asking God to let you take her place or just take it all away.
Hope you'll wake up in the morning, was all just been a dream
You never take for granted every second that you breathe.
When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.
And the seconds turn to minutes
And minutes wouldn't last
And the hours, days and weeks and months
Seem endless and too fast
And the blessings poured from Heaven
Like the rain on that first spring
Since that moment I first saw you
You might not always be with me.
When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind, in my mind.

Now that you're wondering how must they feel
Meaning them that you've chased across America's movie screens
Now that you're wondering ""how can it be real?""
That the ones you've called colourful, noble and proud
In your school propaganda
They starve in their splendor?
You've asked for my comment I simply will render
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
Now that the longhouses breed superstition
You force us to send our toddlers away
To your schools where they're taught to despise their traditions.
Forbid them their languages, then further say
That American history really began
When Columbus set sail out of Europe, then stress
That the nation of leeches that conquered this land
Are the biggest and bravest and boldest and best.
And yet where in your history books is the tale
Of the genocide basic to this country's birth,
Of the preachers who lied, how the Bill of Rights failed,
How a nation of patriots returned to their earth?
And where will it tell of the Liberty Bell
As it rang with a thud
O'er Kinzua mud
And of brave Uncle Sam in Alaska this year?
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying
Hear how the bargain was made for the West:
With her shivering children in zero degrees,
Blankets for your land, so the treaties attest,
Oh well, blankets for land is a bargain indeed,
And the blankets were those Uncle Sam had collected
From smallpox-diseased dying soldiers that day.
And the tribes were wiped out and the history books censored,
A hundred years of your statesmen have felt it's better this way.
And yet a few of the conquered have somehow survived,
Their blood runs the redder though genes have paled.
From the Grand Canyon's caverns to craven sad hills
The wounded, the losers, the robbed sing their tale.
From Los Angeles County to upstate New York
The white nation fattens while others grow lean;
Oh the tricked and evicted they know what I mean.
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
The past it just crumbled, the future just threatens;
Our life blood shut up in your chemical tanks.
And now here you come, bill of sale in your hands
And surprise in your eyes that we're lacking in thanks
For the blessings of civilization you've brought us,
The lessons you've taught us, the ruin you've wrought us
Oh see what our trust in America's brought us.
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
Now that the pride of the sires receives charity,
Now that we're harmless and safe behind laws,
Now that my life's to be known as yourheritage,
Now that even the graves have been robbed,
Now that our own chosen way is a novelty
Hands on our hearts we salute you your victory,
Choke on your blue white and scarlet hypocrisy
Pitying the blindness that you've never seen
That the eagles of war whose wings lent you glory
They were never no more than carrion crows,
Pushed the wrens from their nest, stole their eggs, changed their story;
The mockingbird sings it, it's all that he knows.
""Ah what can I do?"" say a powerless few
With a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye
Can't you see that their poverty's profiting you.
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying."

You'll find that creature at the bottom of the deep down Susquehanna River.
This one I had stood right on up to me,
Tore out his hook and declared himself a prodigy.
But oh no, fishing ain't what it used to be.
I've seen some bad years, but this one is just killing me.
One little nibble in thirteen years,
I really pack 'em in.
This one I had, I seen it in dreams,
All shacked up with lightning and horizon beams.
Well I bring 'em on up, and then I pack 'em on in
In all the places I've been,
And I swear it's never been like this before,
Least not since 19 and 44.
But today, I made a sick discovery,

Well I brought him on up and then I packed him on in, oh yes,
Now I'm really cashing in.

Grim cascades of light construct a blurry image
The fridge-cage opens serving a putrid stiff
Rusted will serve up the casual plat du jour
Heat up the stove, my banquet commence
Amputate limbs, Delicatesse in extremis
There is no taste, like human rosbeef, haute-cuisine
Savouring every chunk that slides down the esophague
Feasting on man I survive reluctant and digestive
Sanguine, my culinary addiction
Just doing my part in depopulation
Another day, another night to rob the morgue
Retrieving chunks to stew what i adore
Exhuming chunks to flavour the casserole
I'm the grand chef brewfing a new brand of food
Feasting in man I survive, reluctant, and digstive
Your relatives, I shove down my throat
Feeding of hate, preying on man, cannibalism with a cause

and I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction

A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008
This music gave me a lane to ride in, but there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a [?] of a lion
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars
you can't gamble with no cards
what d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar
to find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark
Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
Listen, listen, the music that we play
Will ease your mind
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly
But when I'm writing songs, I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's ease
I am a man with a heavy heart,
and I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
I...
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation
Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on U.K. streets
when a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk
Listen, we all get down in the dumps
but when they hear the melody and base line pump
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then I run loose on my tongue
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton
Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
Listen, listen, the music that we play
Will ease your mind
I am a man with a heavy heart,
And I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation."

I've got nothing to say. You've been leaving all day.
Now it's time that you go, and let me cry.
You've got somewhere to be;
You're still waiting on me,
But there's no reason to say good-bye.
Leaves fall as the trees give up the view,
And lies will fall away, leaving you.
So don't keep waiting around
For some words to be found
Saying ""Everything's fair in love, and war""
The truth has changed how I see.
Now you look different to me:
You are not who I loved before.
I dreamed it was true, what I saw in you,
'cause that's what a dreamer does
But the love that I dreamed is not what it seemed,
I guess that it never was
So I will say my good-byes, but not to your eyes,
For the one that I loved is gone, somehow
For without all the lies, without that disguise,
You're just a stranger now.

About the years gone by
How he played his horn down in New Orleans
In some old dingy dive

As he reached out for his horn
He closed his eyes - and wet his lips
Then the blues were born.
He played with so much feelin'
Tears came from his eyes
He stopped and reminisced a bit
And then he gave a sigh!
Said, ""You know, I almost made it
But that was before your time
Dixieland, Po' Folks Blues
ScatMan Jack and wine.""
Slapped his knee and gave a grin
It sure was good back then
Reaching for his horn on the floor
Placed it in an old towsack
That hung across his back
He said ""Goodbye!""
And shuffled out the door.
Enthused by what he told me
I never got his name
So, I called the waitress over
And started to explain
A tired old man - his tarnished horn
Mem'ries of years gone by
How he played his horn and reminisced
Smiled with tear-dimmed eyes.
She said you are mistaken
There's been no one but you
But I know who you're talkin' 'bout
I used to know him, too
You'll find him down on Basin Street
In back of an old churchyard
A stone that reads, ""Rest in Peace
I tried but it sure was hard.""

That love is wrong and girls

I guess I'll never figure out
What womankind is all

Come all ye lads and lasses, and hear my mournful tale,
Ye tender hearts that weep for love to sigh you will not fail,
'Tis all about a young man, and my song will tell you how
He lately came a-courtin' of the Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe.
Said he, ""My pretty young fair maid, could you and I agree,
To join our hands in wedlock bands, and married we will be;
We'll join our hands in wedlock bands, and you'll have my plighted vow,
That I'll do my whole endeavors for the Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe.
Now this young and pretty fickle thing, she knew not what to say,
Her eyes did shine like silver bright, and merrily did play;
Says she, ""Young man, your love subdue, I am not ready now,
And I'll spend another season at the foot of the Sweet Brown Knowe.""
""Oh,"" says he, ""My pretty young fair maid, now why do you say so?
Look down in yonder valley where my verdant crops do grow.
Look down in yonder valley at my horses and my plough,
All at their daily labor for the Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe.""
""If they're at their daily labor, kind sir, it is not for me.
I've heard of your behavior, I have, kind sir, "" said she;
""There is an inn where you drop in, I've heard the people say,
Where you rap and you call and you pay for all, and go home by the break of
day.""
""If I rap and I call and I pay for all, my money is all my own.
I've never spent aught of your fortune, for I hear that you've got none.
You thought you had my poor heart broke in talkin' to you now,
But I'll leave you where I found you, at the foot of the Sweet Brown Knowe.""

Lyrics by: Carly Simon
Children carry through the streets
A brightly painted star
Angels gather 'round the hearth
Strumming on guitars
Men of great renown and faith
Say prayers on boulevards
It's the night before Christmas
But you don't have to be an angel
To sing harmony
And you don't have to be a child
To love the mystery
And you don't have to be a wise man
On bended knee
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The night before Christmas
The night before Christmas
If you're heart's been longing
And you've been afraid to try
Sorrow's kept you company
And the dance has passed you by
I'll lift you up and blaze with you
Across the moonlit sky
On the night before Christmas
'Cause you don't have to be an angel
To sing in harmony
And you don't have to be a child to love the mystery
And you don't have to be a wise man
On bended knee
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The night before Christmas

In that belief we watch over the dead
Standing aside their graves
Talking to a molten stone
Trying to understand the reason
Why their hands aren't warm
I saw the stately men in robes walking from the forest
Their empty and childish eyes
So sad and mourning with us
They take the soul away
Every year at the first light of spring
With the soft wind blowing through my hair
I lay the rose upon her grave
In hope that she'll return to me someday
Hand in hand they wander across the great rainbow
Far away from worry they'll be safe
In a land where fear is not existing
She's like me, she never wanted to be
Purified in the fountain of lies
Her rage could not be wiped away
Now escaped from the light and it's dream angels
I saw her riding towards me on thunder clouds
I laid the rose upon her grave
And now she has returned to me"

-Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned. Out of the cold mist
came three entbralling ships. Sails torn by many storm, and the
bows adorned by the most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon.
Yet, the crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They stood
motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns. And from behind their
shadowed faces the seductive chanting. Bidding him on board.
Without hesitation, he accepted. And away they sailed... -
Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of dignity
Still my flames are in hunger
With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn
Desire...
Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this momnet I am struck blind
Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in the realm of death
Hear my call...

Sticks and stones may break my bones

I get down on my knees and I pray for rain

There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face

Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !
What's your problem ? What's your curse ?
Won't it make the matter worse ?

And they say "" Faith can move move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul ""
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter - No !

When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day

When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin drawn between friend and foe

It's hard moving on from the things you done wrong,
When they play in your head like an old fashioned song
But when you're wearing on your sleeve,
All the things you regret,
You can only remember what you want to forget
Lonely miles,
Without you

Let the water be my home

A porch with its columns all covered with vine
My broken dream house where he lives with another

Two little children that look like their daddy
With the same smile and the same eyes that shine
The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy

The plans that we made never can be

""At last after endless searching i have found him the dark prince!
I fought my way up the highest mountain, and found him laughing on
his throne made of the rotting carcasses of my people.
To kill him, their leader is to defeat them all, i must win! This is my only
chance,
To save all i have ever lived for!
FEAR...i must stay strong, it's been hard and i lost most of my loved ones.
This is for them, this is for Dragonland!!!
DIE, evil twisted creature...DIE!!!""
Eye to eye, with our destinies
Sword to sword, Will set one free
Light to darkness, The future will be set
Darkness to light, This will be the end
For hours we fought
Wounded and tired with no end in sight
The storm draws near
Upon the highest mountain we stand
Steel against steel as we strike yet again
Face to face we will fight to the death
Then a mortal blow brings me to my knees
All hope's gone, Dragonland is doomed
As i'm bleeding
My life is draining away
In a world now embraced by darkness
Evil's beginning to rise
Soon the world will come to an end and all good will die
Though the clan of dragons will survive
someday in the future might a hero arise
But can they hold on for so long?
[Solo: O.M, N.M]
Withered forests the homes of elves decayed
Crumbled mountains the dwarves will be no more
Shattered cities the humans slowly die
Pungent wastelands the dark ones marching on
Nothing is spared
All in their path will be destroyed
Their reign of terror
Has barely begun
Now the hordes of night begins their feast of victory
Burning down and slaying everything
Dark clouds cover the whole sky and black rain starts to fall
And will do for ages come to pass
Hundred years have passed now it is time to strike back
Time to raise our swords and shields again
But who will lead us, the armies of light this time?
In the den of dragons hope is born..."

I say this twisted prayer for you
May the torment you put out
Come back around twice multiplied.
Even though you let me go
I've got to let you know
I'd cry if you died.
The past is where you see me
The past is what will bring you down
Destiny a moon eclipsed
In the shadows all is darkness now
May the evil in your heart
Be your one and only friend for life
You pretend I don't exist
I have to let you know
I'd cry if you died
Somewhere special
Voices form words
And the words have meaning
So I reach out for someone new
And I wonder
Will it ever be alright
(then I hear you secret radio
Signaling that its time to go)
Hell is where you put me
And hell is where well meet again
I will be waiting"

far across the fields.

Cool rain from a cloud of strickenine
But maybe, just maybe
This soul will die before my body
And I'll live on earth in peace for evermore
And so it goes
Lately I've thought about me
Separate from your woeful morning
And I can see a light ringing through the sky
It sings of coming glory
Strangely tied to this awful story
It lifts the heart and gives us wings to fly
And so it goes"

And you know it's not like she's forgot about him
She's just dealing with the pain
And the fact that she's survived so well without him
You know it's driving him insane
And the crazy thing about it
Is she'd take him back
But the fool in him that walked out
Is the fool who just won't ask
She's gonna make it

searching the insanity of mine
mourning as I dwell among no laughter
hoping my existence ends hereafter
Astray the bridge I burned
to where sorrows fade
this torment now I earned
Emptiness is character of my destiny
my soul is drained and nowhere is
where I will be
Shadows... Of starlike blackened fire
taking... This soul to its loathsome trial
through astral layers the voyage goes on
perished among the stars
forever to be gone
to where nothing is and nothing was
...and their whispers greet my loss
In the watery mirror of destiny
I can not see my own reflection
through the dead halls of infinity
I hear them sing for me"

She said, ""Could you tell him that I love him

Said, ""Honey who you talking to?""

Love you all over again
All over again

Girl since I've been on my own

Thinkin' of you and all the love we shared
Looking back I don't know why I got scared
I had it all but now your love has gone

When I walked out on you
I knew what I did was so wrong

Love you all over again

Lost my wife and fam'ly no one to call friend
Don't tell me your troubles I got enough of my own
Be thankful you're living drink up and go home

Yet he's not complaining why should you or me

I can call a car it will be two minutes

It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone
So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine, but
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you've been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you
There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night

And try moving on together, together

Maybe that's the reason she lied
Remy said that he was only looking for a friend
The night they asked him up inside
No one knows exactly what went down in that room
How the truth came out or from whose lips
Sometimes it builds up like a dam it bursts
Other times it stumbles and slips
Till it all comes out
Go on and jump and shout
But it's going to take a war to stop it
Remy said a scar ran down the side of his face
The cop said, ""Son, that isn't enough""
Well, he called himself the Greek but he only spoke French
We met him after hours at the club
Mellissa said she fainted at the sight of it all
She said, Remy had to carry me out
See I'd never seen a gun up close in person before
And the words like honey poured from her mouth
And it all came out
Go on and jump and shout
But it's going to take a war to stop it
Remy gave a statement with his fingers crossed
He said, I hope this means that I can still vote
When they brought Melissa in she didn't look at him once
She hung her head and she read from her notes
The Greek faced the camera - didn't utter a word
He couldn't speak or even move his head
The prosecutor stood - cracked a joke and he smiled
Said you don't know it son, but you're already dead
And it all came out
Go on and jump and shout
But it's going to take a war to stop it
""I may never even get to see you again""
Remy said, ""I ain't done nothing""
Tighten up your panties boy
Loosen up your wig
You better pray nobody finds you
Now Mellissa's got a family and a government job
(And) No one ever mentions the past
Sometimes she lays awake in the middle of the night
Wondering how long can this fairy tale last
Me I took a train to the border that night
I spend a little time in Berlin
Sometimes I think I'll give Mellissa a call
But I wouldn't know where to begin
Till it all comes out
Go on and jump and shout
But it's going to take a war to stop it"

It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides the perfect little boy inside the man
I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe that those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys
Tonight I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After Christmas Eve with my best and closest friend
Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in
And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides this perfect little boy inside a man

Hiding in the street,

Now hounds of love are hunting.

And I don't know what's good for me.

It's coming for me through the trees.

Help me, please!
Take my shoes off,
And throw them in the lake,
And I'll be
Two steps on the water.

Caught by dogs.
He let me take him in my hands.
His little heart,
It beats so fast,
And I'm ashamed of running away
From nothing real--
I just can't deal with this,
But I'm still afraid to be there,
Among your hounds of love,
And feel your arms surround me.
I've always been a coward,
And never know what's good for me.

A jewel more radiant than the moon
Lowered Her mask to me
The sublimest creature the Gods, full of fire
Would marvel at making their Queen
Infusing the air with Her fragrant desire
And my heart reeled with grave poetry
From grace I fell in love with Her
Scent and feline lure
And jade woodland eyes that ushered in the impurest
""Erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm Autumn night
She lulled me away from the rich masquerade
And together we clung in the bloodletting moonlight""
Pearled luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
Her icy kiss fervoured my neck
Like whispering waves 'pon Acheron's beach
In a whirl of sweet voices and statues
That phantomed the dying trees
This debauched seductress in black, took me
In a pale azured dawn like Ligeia reborn
I tore free of my sleep - sepulchre
On the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
Lamented the spectre of Her
Bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
I hungered for past overtures
The curse of unrest and her ardent caress
Came much more than my soul could endure
I, at once endeavoured to see Her again
Stirring from midnight's inertia
Knowing not even her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss
I danced like a blind acolyte
Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night
For hours I scoured the surrounding grounds
In vain that we might meet
When storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
I sought refuge in a cemeterty
Sleep, usher dreams
Taint to nightmares from a sunless nether
Mistress of the dark
I now know what thou art
Screams haunt my sleep
Dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together
Lamia and Lemures
Spawned thee leche
To snare my flesh
Portrait of the Dead Countess
Deep stained pain that I had dreamt
Flaunted demise, life's punishment
Leaving little strength to seal this wretched tomb
But poised nectar within my stirs
Up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
Through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
Goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
In flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
Glimpses of a heaven where ghost companies fell
To mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette
""Fleeting, enshadowed
Thou art privy to my sin
Secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
The cruel daylights upon my skin?
Dost thou not want to worship me
With crimson sacrifice
So my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
And weep with new-found life?""
Red roses for the Devil's whore
Dark angels taste my tears
And whisper haunting requiems
Softly to mine ear
Need-fires have lured abominations here
Nocturnal pulse
My veins spill forth their waters
Rent by lips I cherish most
Awash on her perfidious shores
Where drowning umbra o'er the stars
Ebon's graves where lovers whore
Like seraphim and Nahemah
""Nahemah""
Pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
Blind reason against thee, Enchantress
For I must know, art thou not death?
My heart echoes bloodless and incensed
Doth temptation prowl night in vulvic revelry
Did not the Queen of Heaven come as Devil to me?
On that fatal Hallow's Eve when we fled company
As the music swept around us in the crisp, fated leaves
UNder horned Diana where her bloodline was sewn
In a graveyard of Angels rent in cool marbled stone
I am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
Enrobed in Death's shadow like a swifter

You had your faults, I had mine. Nothing's perfect, is it, baby?
If we'd given it the time, could have worked things out, well, maybe
Came to thinkin' what the hell
Not to dwell up on the problems
Our bodies came together well
And that was all we cared
More and more and more and more
More of the people gave up looking for
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say
""The road to understanding was just too far away.""
While we watched the little things getting out of all proportion
There was so much more at stake, but we paid it no attention
I suppose if we had tried
We'd have saved the pot from boiling
But we went and let it slide
Until we lost control
And more and more and more and more
More of the people gave up looking for
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say
""The road to understanding was just too far away.""
What was bad got worse, what was good just got forgotten
Could have stopped it there and then, but, girl, we didn't cotton
In the end we didn't care
All the love flew out the window
And I guess, just like you said
It all got outta hand
And more and more and more and more
More of the people gave up looking for
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say

But they believe the one you vow to love
Should always stay that same
And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation under way
For a love to last forever or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind
And they made their house from a tool shed
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
They taught us 'bout good living
They taught is right and wrong
Lord there'll never be another place
In this world I'll call home
My momma raised five children, four girls then there was me
She found her strength with faith in God and love of family
She never had a social life, home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job, to play a bill or two
My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money but he gave us all he had
He never made the front page but he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from miles around
To let him look underneath the hood
And they made their house from a tool shed

And they built walls all around it

Hoping to escape their deaths but this is what they found
Bodies stacked in massive piles and mass graves overflowing
As the cholera camps are waiting for the aid to finally come
The Rwandan refugees are dying by the thousands every day
While clean water needed to preserve life is supposedly on it's way

Now we try to help these people but we're too fucking late
Too little, too late
We control the third world's fate
Our high standard of living contributes to their deaths
And the truth behind the bloodshed is what our government protects
But the fault is also ours because we're killing with our greed
For our material possessions we confuse our wants with need
The companies and the media promote these capitalist views,
Praising the American way of life, never asking at whose expense
So if you think we're helping then you're really fucking blind
Because we're after special interests and the rest we leave behind
Too little, too late

Now we try to help these people but we're too fucking late

Entry to the United States because our government doesn't deem it necessary
To help our fellow man, so if they can't make us money
They don't want them in our land
Panama and Nicaragua were some to receive our ""aid"",
So what kind of difference did we make beside the loss of lives?
And how is life in BOSNIA? Did the problems disapear?
And what about Rwanda is their water now crystal clear?

A bad one will take you for more

Than to be forgotten, but not gone
Somehow he can't remember, when he's late to even take the time to call
And even on the nights he's there she gets the feeling he's not there at all
She's become a prisoner in that big old house where sweet love used to be

Das Kind, das ich einst war, sah still und lnger hin,
Es ruhte auf der Luft ...
doch irgenddann brach ich aus mir herab.
Ich fiel hinein in die Zeit, doch leider nicht unendlich weit ...
Mein Schmetterfels : Vergnglichkeit.
Und whrend mein Blick nun jahrelang durch
Gedankenscherben strich,
sich nur schmerzlich weiten konnte, flog die Zeit in meinem
Schatten, und drngte traurig heimlich
mich.
Erst an welker Nchte Morgen, als scherbenfrei der Blick sich
spannte, sah ich in seiner ganzen Flle, Die Zeit, die sich
""mein Leben"" nannten, ja, die ich einst als Kind schon kannte,
ein Lichtspiel eines kindlichen Seins, das wandelfarb'nen
Blickes
mich, ja mich, erwnschte.
Ihr Blick glitt weich in Silben :
""Ich bin Dein einzig' Publikum,
drum mein Wesen fhl' vertraut,
la sehn wohin man durch Dich schaut
und fhlen mich mit Deiner Haut,
Ich erlebe, was Dir wirklich ist.
Ich bin Dein einzig' Publikum,
drum mein Wesen denk' vertraut,
Ich mchte, was Dein Geist anstaunt.
Sei
Ich bin inbei.""
Sie schmiegte sich wild an meine Hlle,
Taumelasche sprach von ""Wind"",
Sie ist Neugier - die Endlose,
Staubfliehender hie dies ""Hast"".
Sie nahm meine Gesten,
wie Ich sie innigst meinte,
und ehe Ich ""AlleinSein"" sehnte,
erflo Sie all mein Sein
langsam, dunkel, voll und sanft ...
Jetzt bin ich beinah wieder Kind,
frei belebe ich jeden Moment,
ohne Furcht vor vielem Gestern,
denn in Zeit bin ich mir selbst Geschenk.
Der Moment ist dabei Publikum.
Mein Lidschlag fordert ihn heraus,
mein Lcheln ist wie sein Applaus,
Und manchmal gleicht mein leerer Blick
seinem enttuschten Entsetzen,
denn wenn ich ihm nichts mehr zeigen kann,
erhebt er sich - verlt mich schnell,
und nur einem gefllt meine starre Not,
nun ist es vorbei.
Denn da klatscht
Der Tod."

Feeling on my flow now she really wanna go
Tell her that I love her but she knows it ain't so
Her heart starts racing now she's ready to explode
Ima make her mine by the end of the show
Verse 1:
Hook line sinker, got her turn like a blinker
Have her bouncing out her clothes
While I'm jumping out the speaker
Keep it kicking like a sneaker
And she knows I wanna freak her
Baby girl I don't know your name
But I'd really like to meet ya, oh
Let's go on a full speed grind
Keep your two cents
My baby girl's a dime
Fine, mine, and so divine
She got her mouth open while I'm blowing her mind
Got her showing her shine, with her lip gloss on
Melting in my hands while I rip this song
Flip that on, don't get me wrong
Ima hit that shit like all night long

Verse 2:
Jazz it up, shake it out
She got me going crazy when she break it down
That body vibrating when we play it loud
Hat turned back with the A-town down
She's the only one that I see in here
All decked out in the AK gear
I'm like, hey there dear, put your name on here
If the fame ain't clear then the game gon' steer
Pedal to the metal now she's hot as flames
All we really want is some whips and chains
Yo, call her highness, baby's still the finest
Chick that I see even through the blindness
With my guidance she could be timeless
So rewind this, study what I'm finding
She gon' want a label that is prolly gonna bind us
All I gotta say is don't try this, flyness

Bridge/Verse 3:
I watched a butterfly go shutter by
Now she's digging in on this gutter guy
And I wonder why she's hooked on me
Must be the way that I move the beat
Or move my feet, so smoothily
Heart starts pounding, sounding good to me
Groove and sing, just feel the vibe
I'm locked on my red lipped cyanide
Guys have tried, but she shot 'em down
She only looking for that man with the golden crown
She can scan around but she knows I'm down
She can see it in my eyes and the way I sound
You feeling it, I'm feeling it
You killing it, I'm killing it
Lets be real girl

Down on the shoulder he's running as fast as he can
Dying to hold her, he's truly a desperate man
And he falls to his knees at the wreck
Up close it all looks so much worse
Same color, same model, but the car in the crash isn't hers
He really loves you
And God knows it's true
And it's something he'd say
And he'd tell you each day
It was the way that he knew

Handed over to grief's embrace...

Is bleeding and crying
With our torn apart
You took in your hand
The autumn's tear
Spilt on the emotion
You caused by forsaking me
You were the last scrap of life
Within my being
You tore up an eternal wound
You left me dying...

That I felt this love was killing me
And pain was tearing me apart...

She left in a world of emptiness I'm wondering what happened to my happiness
The reason for it all was in a letter that I've found
All she said and all I read was Joe is back in town
Joe is back in town that's what she said today she let me down wish I was dead
I was standing in for him I know but still I hang around

And no one could ever look more out of place,
Than me on a dance floor with egg on my face,
Dancing an Irish waltz.
I looked up and couldn't believe what I saw,
The kind of face I'd only dreamed of before,
So I swallowed my pride, and I took to the floor,
As the band played an Irish waltz.
One two three went my heart, and we smiled as we swayed,
And the band sweetly played,
My legs felt like lead, there were stars in my head,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
I was clumsy and dark foot, and so ill at ease,
Blood rushed to my head while the strength left my knees,
But the moment that stole on my memories,
Is when we danced an Irish waltz?
One two three went my heart, and we smiled as we swayed,
And the band sweetly played,
My legs felt like lead, there were stars in my head,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
Oh we've been together for years since that night,
My two left feet still can't quite get it right,
Our children look on, and they laugh with delight,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
One two three went my heart, and we smiled as we swayed,
And the band sweetly played,
My legs felt like lead, there were stars in my head,
When we danced an Irish waltz.

seek out and maim, Six feet is the depth of my obsession, Adding

disarray, A cadaveric splatter platter carved, hacked and flayed, Imbibing
blood and alcohol til vomit flows red, Then back to the grave for indignities
to the dead... Necromaniac... The naked and the dead gore whore slashed,
Opened her torso after plundering her gash, A bone fucking, pus grinding
necromaniac, Assaulting the dead with this fucking gore attack... In the

This guy has come between us
And now those days are missed

Just know that I'm wishing

You'll forget about that guy
And then you'll know why

Would I still stand a chance
And now this disaster
Would be in the past
We could make out to a song
San Dimas was always gold
You know I loved to so long
Just wish that you were told
I'd be holding your hand
And we'd make our own plans
We could go on a date
They'd all stop and stare
My hands through your hair
When we go out to eat
I don't want to let you go away

no spirits hard at work, no unseen hand at play
people talk like it's a given thing
I dunno what they mean -- nor, I suspect, do they
I guess that's OK
But how do you know I'm not a sentimental man?
is it really so hard to see these things? I guess it is
I couldn't tell you why, I think it's right there
nobody's perfect, but I'm doing what I can
and you best believe I'll keep it real
I'm an old testament type of guy
I like my coffee black, and my parole denied
even as I flake on every deal
I ever made with myself, before the ink could dry
Well I should keep that one inside...
How do you know I'm not a sentimental man?
is it really so hard to catch that vibe? I guess it is
I couldn't tell you why, I think it's plain to see
certain disaster, and I really couldn't say how the fuck I could let this get
so far
How do you know that I'm not your biggest fan?
Can you really make that case so clear? I think you can't
I don't know why you try, I guess it's all a game
I'm under the covers and I'm telling you good night

Must I accept his fate
Or take myself far from this place
I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice
When he wants every thing
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in the mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again

Trained for battle, prepared to die, you don't give a damn.
Your weapon is your life and love shooting the enemy down.
Killing women and children and everyting around
First fought for freedom now for pleasure, you've become obsessed
Never feel at ease until you're laid to rest
Sargeant tells you and you carry out his every command.
No return from this life you're on the 4 year plan.

There's no retreat
Live to fight

Losh! I thought that the sound o' the happer
Said, ``Tak' hame a wee flow to your wife,
To help to mak' brose to your supper.''
Then my conscience was narrow and pure,
But someway by random it rackit;
For I lifted twa neivefu' or mair,
While the happer said, ``Tak' it, man tak' it.''
Then hey for the mill and the kiln,
The garland and gear for my cogie,
And hey for the whisky and gill,
That washes the dust frae my craigie.
Although it's been lang in repute
For rogues to mak' rich by deceiving,
Yet I see that it disna weel suit
Honest men to begin to the thieving.
For my heart it gaed dunt upon dunt,
Oh, I thought ilka dunt it wad crack it;
Sae I flang frae my neive what was in't,
Still the happer said, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
A man that's been bred to the plough,
Might be deav'd wi' its clamorous clapper;
Yet there's few but would suffer the sough,
After kenning what's said by the happer.
I whiles thought it scoff'd me to scorn,
Saying, ``Shame, is your conscience no chackit?''
But when I grew dry from a horn,
It chang'd aye to ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
The smugglers whiles cam' wi' their pocks,
'Cause they kent that I likit a bicker,
Sae I bartered whiles wi' the gowks,
Gied them grain for a sowp o' their liquor.
I had lang been accustomed to drink,
And aye when I purposed to quat it,
That thing wi' its clappertie clink
Said aye to me, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
But the warst thing I did in my life,
Nae doot but ye'll think I was wrang o't;
Od! I tauld a bit bodie in Fife
A' my tale, and he made a bit sang o't.
I have aye had a voice a' my days,
But for singin' I ne'er gat the knack o't;
Yet I try whyles, just thinking to please
The greedy, wi' ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
Now, miller and a' as I am,
This far I can see through the matter;
There's men mair notorious to fame,
Mair greedy than me o' the muter.
For 'twad seem that the hale race o' men,
Or, wi' safety, the hauf we may mak' it,
Ha'e some speaking happer within,
That said to them ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''"

To buy me a bottle of beer
And I sat me down by a tender young lady
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
For something un-foolish to say
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows
And smilingly stole her away
CHORUS
I said, Hey, little girl
Don't you know he's a devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his shadow to blame
And some people swear he's my double
And some even say we're the same
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We'll take our own chances and pay our own dues
The silver tongued devil and I
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cause she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of somethin' that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone

In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid

With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar

And soaked in blue light he played and played

Billy burned his phone and blew up his car
He sat and watched TV and played the guitar
And read a book that made his head spin

And now that you're gone

And I took them hoping for some silly reason

Turned the gray skies to blue
I sobered up knowing she'd never be able

The longest day of life we'd ever seen
But we lived to tell the story and we know the story well
The day we ran the rapids of the Green
We were thirty-two in number when we gathered on the shore
And we headed off into the great unknown
But we summoned up our courage an' we formed a mighty team
And we ran that ragin' river all alone
Yeah, the gods were runnin' with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
[Echoing shouts.]
And we hear a thousand echoes on the mighty canyon walls
As we shouted from the waters far below
And we saw the ancient warnings and we heard the ghostly cries
Of the men who ran the river long ago
And we prayed that they were with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
[Echoing shouts.]
Now the memories are swirlin' in the eddies of our minds
But the waters of the Green are flowin' clear
And the canyon of Lodore will be a long remembered tale
To be told around the campfires through the years
Yeah, the gods were runnin' with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
[Chorus]
And we died a thousand times in that forty miles of hell
The longest day of life we'd ever seen
But we lived to tell the story and we know the story well
The day we ran the rapids of the Green

Do they think we're idiots? But I bought 'em
Now I'm standing in a subway car
I ride because I cannot walk far
I couldn't find an empty cab on the street
They were filled with high-heeled women with non-functioning feet
Twenty-six years ago I dreamed of wearing shoes like these
Oh, the warped mind of the preteen with her strange priorities
But this is a nightmare
Of unsteady ankles, hands waving in the air
But the looks my legs
Are getting from that man across the aisle
Almost make the pain and misery
And doctor bills worthwhile
If by chance you happen to meet
This wobbly woman walking down your street
The click of high heels on concrete
Is not the thrill of victory, it's the agony of defeat
Oh! Look at me everybody I learned this from Paula Abdul
Oh, take pity on my vanity, maybe question my sanity
Why I wear these uncomfortable things? Heaven knows
Which make me wonder about these pierced earrings
And my pantyhose, my control top
Ooh, I can see you don't want me to sing about pantyhose
You'd rather I go back to tap dancing
Like my close personal friend Paula Abdul
Who, like me, was a geek back in high school
Oh, I'm sorry, but that's not what this song is about
At least it wasn't when it started out

I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on
Get down to the water, before all the crowds
Gonna have more fun than the law allows
With my hot rod, I go out to prove
When I'm on the prowl, I never lose
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down
'Cause I've got the fastest fishing boat in town
I open up my tackle box, it's so big!
Crank baits, sink baits, beer and jigs
Got my bobbers on, and my 10 pound test
Gonna catch me a lunker gonna be the best
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts
Ahhh, fishing!
I fish on the lake, by the sunken tree stump
Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree
It's a good thing that fish can't read
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one

(Tug, tug, tug, tug, tug that line)
I'm gonna catch a fish, it's gonna be so fine

I saw turrets of Victorian wealth
I saw John the ex-fox
Sleeping in some outside bogs
There's a silent rumble
In the buildings of the night council
It's a meeting of controllers
Who drive right through the gates
In white roll-tops
And I guess this just goes to show

In a tongue-tired, wired state
Cause Sunday morning dancing
I had an awake dream
I was in the supervision dept.
Of a bigtown store
Security floors one to four
They had cameras in the clothes dummies.
A man came up to them
He wanted sex in the dummies eyes
Then came up the cry:
""Security, mobilized!""
Meanwhile in the sticks
Proles rich, dance in cardboard pants
And I guess this goes to show
The lie dream of a casino souls scene"

Memories of torment strikes me
Attempts were made to suffocate me at birth
Fools
I was already ancient
Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee
Alas, this agony
The emptiness of earthborn pride
Hath stirred my faithful heart
Which guided me to darker paths
Far away from their pestilent ways
Cleansed was I from deceitful grace
Yet, put to scorn was I
By those unclean
Enslaved by ignorance
They blindly spat upon the deity of hate
Awake is the darkest fiend
By the fallen one I shall arise
Upon bewildered masses
To whom the indulgence of my soul
Portray as sin made god
I shall revile and quell the source
Whence mockery of my kind derive

Facile shalt my quest not come to pass
Deathwish be my gift to all at last
Honour
Commended no longer as virtue
Yet, shalt be extolled at light's demise

A harlot who was hot to trot
Gave a fine little bijou to the world
With a blacksmith for a makeshift doc
In a cathouse far from camelot
Her gold mine brought to bed a baby girl
When the child screamed from life's first slap
The bawd said kid get used to that
You'll never meet a day that isn't cruel
Then she wrapped her babe in a petticoat
Grabbed a bottle and made a toast
Here's to my gorgeous bastard ruby jewel
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel
Reared among the guttersnipe
While her mama puffed the chinese pipe
The salad days for ruby didn't last
Forced to work and pay her dues
Inside that poor man's moulin rouge
The snot-nosed kid had to grow up fast
Night and day she'd toil and sweat
While brothel patrons placed their bets
On who would be the first to break her in
Then one night the madam screams
Ruby get to room thirteen
There's someone there who thinks you're quite a gem
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby no not ruby ruby jewel
In done up hair and a borrowed dress
She climbed the stares scared to death
Said a prayer and tip-toed through the door
But on deaf ears her prayer fell
Cause through her tears she stared at hell
Standing there in nothing but his drawers
She recognized the whiskered chin
Bloodshot eyes and foul-mouthed grin
He was the man who wore the silver star
She tried to turn around and run
But he pulled out his big six gun
And said whore you won't get very far
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel
Ruby jewel woke up in bed
A crimson pool between her legs
Naked as the day that she was born
But lying there next to him
Made her wish she hadn't been
If this was all that living had in store
Making sure he was asleep
She quietly got to her feet
Found his gun and aimed it 'tween his eyes
She kept it there 'til he came to
So he could stare down the barrel too
Pulled the trigger once and watched him die
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby no not ruby ruby jewel
On a rainy night in nineteen-twelve
Locked inside the town's new jail
Ruby carved a message in the stone
When morning came hacks led her out
In ankle chains right through the crowd
Who waited in the mud to watch the show
They walked her up the gallows steps
But the rope around her neck
Dropped the trap as all the watchers cheered
But on the wall of her cell
In a tiny scrawl and misspelled
Were the words ruby jewel was here
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel"

beckoning the shepherd to rise from the ground
THE SHEPHERD:
""What sweet voice does sing in such a woebegone tone?
What maiden does wander the heather alone?""
Bewitched by its tone, he followed her song,
whilst the sun did descend and the shadows grew long
In the dim light of dusk, near the sparkling cascade
on a moss covered stone sat a crying young maid

""Why art thou dreary? What happened to thee?
What song didst thou sing so woefully?""

""Go whither O shepherd! Don't sadden thine heart
Thou canst not help me - not thou who thou art!

of a tree that at least a hundred years stood,
cut by a boy who at heart was still pure -

(William Rooney)
When you honor in song and in story
The names of the patriot men,
Whose valor has covered with glory
Full many a mountain and glen,
Forget not the boys of the heather
Who rallied their bravest and best
When Ireland was broken in Wexford
And looked for revenge to the West.
cho: I give you the gallant old West, boys,
Where rallied our bravest and best
When Ireland lay broken and bleeding;
Hurrah for the men of the West!
The hilltops with glory were glowing
'Twas the eve of a bright harvest day,
When the ship we'd been wearily waiting
Sailed into Killala's broad bay.
And over the hills went the slogan
To awaken in every breast
The fire that has never been quenched, boys,
Among the true hearts of the West.
cho:
Killala was ours ere the midnight,
And high over Ballina town
Our banners in triumph were waving
Before the next sun had gone down.
We gathered to speed the good work, boys
The true men from near and afar;
And history can tell how we routed
The redcoats through old Castlebar.
cho:
And pledge me the stout sons of France, boys,
Bold Humbert and all his brave men,
Whose tramp, like the trumpet of battle,
Brought hope to the drooping again.
Since Ireland has caught to her bosom
On many a mountain and hill
The gallants who fell, so they're here, boys,
To cheer us to victory still.
cho:
Though all the bright dreamings we cherished
Went down in disaster and woe,
The spirit of old is still with us
That never would bend to the foe.
And Connaught is ready whenever
The loud rolling tuck of the drum
Rings out to awaken the echoes
And tell us the morning has come.

Those boys ran out from behind the crowd
And watched their daddy die
The big man laughed and said, ""Now look at that

Well, the church doors opened with that black cloak
Flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes
He said, ""Your ticket to hell is a comin' to you
And I got a hollow-point to give you the ride""
And the only thing faster than the cattleman's gun

recorded 1980
You talk about your revolution, well, that's fine
But what are you going to be doing come the time?
Are you going to be the big man with the tommy-gun?
Will you talk of freedom when the blood begins to run?
Well, freedom has no value if violence is the price
Don't want your revolution, I want anarachy and peace
Chorus: You talk of over throwing power with violence as your tool
You speak of liberation and when the people rule
Well ain't it people rule right now, what differnce would there be?
Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me
But what about those people who don't want your new restrictions?
Those that disagree with you and have their own convictions?
You say thay've got it wrong becuase they don't agree with you
So when the recolution comes you'll have to run them through
Yet you say that revoution will bring freedom for us all
Well freedom just ain't freedom when your back's against the wall
Chorus
Will you indoctrinate the masses to serve your new regime?
And simply do away with those whose views are too extreme?
Transportation details could be left to British rail
Where Zyklon B sucessed, North Sea Gas will fail
It's just the same old story of man destroying man
We've got to look for other answers to the problems of this land
Chorus
Vive la revolution, people of the world unite
Stand up of courage, it's your job to fight
It all seems very easy, this revolution game
But when you start to really play thing won't be quite the same
Your intellectual theories on how it's going to be
Don't seem to take into accoutn the true reality
Cos the truth of what you're saying, as you sit there sipping beer
Is pain and death and suffering, but of course you wouldn't care
You're far too much of a man for that, if Mao did it so can you
What's the fredom of us all agaist the suffering of a few?
That's the kind of self-deception that killed ten million jews
Just the same false logic that all power-mogers use
So don't think you can fool me wiht your political tricks
Bovernment is government and all government is force
Left of right, right or left, it takes the same old course
Oppression and restriction, regulation, rule and law
The seizre of that power is all your revolution's for
You romanticise your heroes, qutoe from Marx and Mao
Well thir ideas of freedom are just oppression now
Nothing's changed for all the death that their ideas created
It's just the same fascistic games, but the rules aren't clearly stated
Nothing's really different cos all government's the same
They can call it freedom, but slavery is the game
There's nothgin that you offer but a dream of last years hero
The truth of revolution, bother..................... is year zero"

And it's ""So long girl, I'll see you.""

Like he wants his rodeo

The gold in the buckle

It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive the man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play her game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'

And many moons circle
Through silent the night

By the campfires awaiting the dawn
Two times a hundred men in battles
Tried by the steel in the arrow, axe and the sword
By battle worn, hunger torn, awaiting
For the sun to break through the cold haze
And for the banners of Ebal to appear
On the hill in the sun's first warm rays
The elder among the men looked deep
Into the fire and spoke loud with pride
Tomorrow is a fine day to die

Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
And steel shines bright in the sun's first rays

Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow.

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I want to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, she called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I want to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby
I wanna be where the sun warms the sky
When its time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy...
Loves a girl

This is where I want to be

The sun would set so high

I was a barge without a rudder, loaded with woe. Then I was put on the island of Myself by a wave of the Sea of Life.
There I discovered a snake; then I was illuminated. I saw it was a great secret; they will learn his terror is great.
""Behold!"", said a voice, ""This is Seth, the God of Confusion. Thou art to be a priest of this god and thy name shall be Ni-Khet-Maat.""
I spent five days alone and everything belonged to me when I was in solitude.
I learned that life is probably a cycle and the monument of man is his goodness.
This god addressed me friendlily, as I was like a man seized in pitch black. My soul had gone, my body trembled. My heart was no longer in my body.
""Light in extension! No-one is born wise, don't be arrogant about thy knowledge nor trust that thou art one who knoweth.""
""Behold, the age of Osiris is over. Hail to thee, Crowned and Conquering Child!

Satan came with fire to burn me,
Wouldn't listen when they warned me.
A dagger in my back while she's calling me honey,
Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money.
Thirty minutes after my ship set sail,
She put up a sign and my house began to wail.
But, why, why, why I couldn't see it in my little girl's eyes?
She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me.
And I would ask the woman, ""Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?
You ain't gonna rule me.""
Just when all began to fade,
I reached out, threw the Ace of Spades.
I put her on a train to the Everglades.
Now that it's all over and gone,
Somehow I just don't feel so alone.
But, lie, lie, lie it seemed like such a waste of time.
She did not ever seem to know me,
But, now it's much too late to show me.
But, if I ever see that woman walkin down the street I'll just stand back,

Song sung blue weeping like a willow
Song sung blue sleeping on my pillow
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again

Around 9 o'clock there was a black snake
Crawling up the Latin American stairs
With his slicked black cockroachair
He was greasy lightning
He was looking for someone else
He said, ""I know you, you know me, hey, hey, lezzosee
I'm in the Mood to Mambo""
Yeah, bongo crazy man
Someone else pulled out a gun and said
""It's a little too late for that sort of thing
If you think that you're the white-black snake
Don't go messing with me, I'm not in the mood""
Somebody else pulled
I said ""Don't be rude, just say bongo crazy man""
Yah, been there, done that
Given every tit-for-tat I'm for me
You're for you, let's keep it that way, okay [unverified]
Meanwhile, later on underneath the river
Some frogman slipped on his black beret
Over his skin, tight rubbersuit, black boots
Looking for a place to go an' dive
Heading for the nearest diver's skive
Looking for love on the cheap rate
Go, gonna make it down with you wan' d'ja see?
He said, ""Crazy bongo
I'm in the mood to mambo""
Meanwhile, we can watch the come
Dancing competitions from the Midlands
International Danceband Orchestra
Lifting up their frilly chiffon skirts
They whirled and they twirled
In the late night rustle
To the beat of the muscle
Of the drum man Inanin
He's picking up the beat on the bongo skin
He was lookin' for love underneath that din
He was looking for me
He was looking for you
Till I walked up to the woman and I said
(With a shoe)
I'm in the mood to mambo
Bongo crazy
Shh, let me into one of the secrets of this place
Y'see the late night flick knives
Glitter through the window, careful where you go boy
Those knives are flick flack
Flagging through the dark, man
They're gonna cut your skin
I talked to Fr.Murphy and he swore he wouldn't tell
But some of those boys are gonna go to hell
See they're in the mood to mambo
Crazy bongo
Cha, cha, cha, the fog horns scream
And the boys go, ""Woo Woo""
I don't mind 'cos I'm with you
We go bongo crazy, yes we do
No we don't, bongo crazy"

Counting moments when joy or tears arrive

Sudden, unexpected things come to pass

Perspectives gone and past

Wounds grow deep
Slowly you discern
Your life blood will drain away
The sands of time
Drain from the hourglass

Fraying in your grasp
The gates of death draweth nigh
Morning dawns
The sun begins to rise
Blood and sweat
Cloud your weary eyes
Straining to view your cruel foe
Gripping fear
No one can be seen
Fighting air
Yet your wounds bleed real
You fight the Shadow of Death
Distant form, drawing into sight
A man draws near
With no armor for the fight
Death thrusts the sword in His sight
Hope has gone

Through the blackened sky
He rises and conquers death

I sold me horse and plough,
Me little pigs and cow,
And me little farm of land and I parted.

For I left her there that morning, broken hearted.

Meself, and a hundred more,
To America sailed o'er,
Our fortune to be making, we was thinking;
But when we landed in Yankee land,
They shoved a gun into our hand,
Saying,"" Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln. ""
cho:
General Mahar (Meagher) to us said,
""If you get shot or lose your head,
Every murdered soul of you will get a pension.""
Well, in the war I lost me leg
All I've now is a wooden peg;
I tell you, 'tis the truth to you I'll mention.

In old Ireland, the country I delight in;
And with the devil I do say,

Devoured by solitude, still wrapped in time.
I'm flowing with pain!
Holding myself back in suspicion
And lingering in the dust
The dust of my abandoned remains.
Killed with the dagger of life
Such an exquisite pride in my suffering
Alone, all alone with the emotional
Streams of my soul
So real, so pure yet I'm left aside
Entangled in fear without hope.
I am truly left alone,
But somehow just somehow
It feels like my loneliness is a victory
Over the self-delusion of joy and happiness.
My heart beats faster,
The anguish becomes clearer
And my misanthropic view gets stronger.
Living in the shadows
So proud of being the one,
But desperate
So desperate for a helping hand.
Do I really want to live this life?
I have a thousand reasons to die,
And many millions of tears to cry in silence.
The human plague has emptied my life,
And I curse the day I was born to this world!
Still, no-one else I ever want to be
And no-one else I intend to be
'Cause no-one else I was meant to be!
I need, I want, I long for my retribution
I need, I want, I yearn for my retribution
I want my retribution I want it now!
Unity; a gathering of open wounds,
Of dark of dark clean spirits
What a dream what a dream so distant!
Why should I why should I be alone
When I love when I love my brotherhood?
Shall I die shall I die to be free
When I cry when I cry in silence
So please let me die in silence
Oh my god, let me die in silence!"

And I didn't catch his name pow shot him on the range yow 'cause he was a burglar
Happens in the parks boohoo even in the old days stinking of the burglars
Happens in my home I never see it coming
When I was young we used to put alarms on our doors and screens like a burglar net now that
I'm older I'm sure that's absurd that's the word for the man who collects who's he stealing from next
When I was young my parents yelled beware of the ivory man that will steal and sell now that
I'm older those words are still pure not the look of a crook in his books what's he taking from you?
And worried peeps go on about it
Say a lot of changes better come
A pocket full of change is emptied by
A little gawky bright and bubbly bird
Lots of heroes out there thinking bout it but minutes of their lives are ticking down
And bottles full of love are drunken by a tricky trite and thirsty hungry bird
Blooming tips on tulip cones that
Don't pay out they keep on growing
Costume thieves who never hand back half of what you end up owing

Will soon be clinkin' wearing me for play bracelet on a burglar
Thought I was ok not as bad as some and sunset on the slums see another day happy are the burglars
Brush it all away or do I let it sink in?
Is it my ambition just to turn away?

With a secret in my head
In the back of my backyard
I keep a spaceship in the shed
I lit the engine and took the sky
From up here it looks so nice
I didn't stop until the moon, where I
Picked a flower just for you
[Chorus]
And I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see I would do anything for you
Anything for you
I didn't want to wake you up,
So I put the flower in a cup
On the floor next to your bed
Without a sound I laid my head
Drifted off into a dream
Of what has been and what could be
I saw your tears, I saw you fall
But I saw us rise, I saw it all
And I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see that I would do anything for you
Anything for you
And I never want you to know
All of the lengths I'll go
To find where the flowers grow
Love is never supposed to be
A present under our tree
I do it because I believe

Longing to reach them but frightened to try
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday

The show must go on
And time slipped away
Before you could build
Any castles in spain
The chance had gone by
With nothing to say
And no one to say it to
Nothing has changed
You've still got it all to do
Surely you know

Wish I had a good girl to miss me

Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Filling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

It was the same old same how have you been
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways

To remember a High King, a tyrant of no fear
I am the first son: a commander without a father,
""Fortuitous doom,"" the last of his predictions.
I'll take advantage by igniting the balusters...
Preparing enraged flames with sweltering speed.

Gathering assemblies in days gone by!

And hurls through every valley and mere!

The bleeding is ceaseless, you're turning blue, the end had begun
Set down in writing, flesh, blood and bone, let death be done
The pen is as mighty as the sword, sticks or stones, your end would be cast

Boiling blood will serve to warm this cold clinical embrace
A clean precise cut to mark this morbid meeting place
This knife - point where you and death came face to face...

We move step by step within, without so much as a sound, death's dark design

A slice to the left, then cut back to the right, movements scripted in this
dance of the dead
Motions so deft, recalled by touch not by sight, footprints encrypted by
blood running red...
A pirouette on razor's edge leaves you breathless
The slab plays host to an incisive macabre ballet
A savage, slicing slaughter of the senses
Now splayed...

With a final flick of my wrist

Blood always cries for blood...the blood of the innocent screams for yours... heaven now cries with tears that are flowing forth like a stream and
The blood of your victims shall drip from the skies like rain and may the sun fall into oceans of blood... death and darkness shall reign for ten thousands
Of generations...your children will be drenched in blood... Because he who kills cannot love and he who loves would never kill....
There is no forgiveness and no mercy when mankind forgets its duties to creation and when my last words are spoken your families shall be cursed....
Now take my life, take my blood...to fulfil your hearts of hatred... you wanted the blood from the innocent and soon the innocent will splatter the ground
With yours... and your children shall pay for the sins of their fathers...ten thousand generations in blood.... ... ... he died and his words like thounderous blows
Rang and rolled over the earth... like a breath, like a wind, like a shadow, a phantom... and on the darkened sky crows will appear to bring back the light
To the believers....
This was the day the earth stood still, he left their rotten world behind, murky storm clouds began to darken the sky and in that darkness justice should rise again ..."

The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow"

It was a stylish congregation you could see they had been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the amen corner of that church sat Ol' Brother Ire
And every Sunday he insisted on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he would get behind and miss the words
Well, the choir got so flustered the church was told, then fine
Brother Ire must quit his singing or the choir is going to resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
They got in their big fine car drove up to Ire's door
They found the choirs great trouble sitting there in a big armed chair
The summers golden sum beam lay up on his snow-white hair
Said York, ""We're here with the Vestry's approbation
To discuss a little mater that affects the congregation
Now it seems your voice is interfering with the choir
So if you will just lay out are you listening, Brother Ire?
The old man raised his head a sign he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
""I wonder if beyond the tide that is breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
Will they kick me out up there for singing in Heavens Choir?""
A science filled the room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town, but Brother Ire was dead.
The choir missed him for awhile, but it soon forgot
A few church goers watched the door, but the old man entered not
From far away his voice is sweet now and he sings his hearts desires
Where there are no committees and no fashionable choirs
Rock of age's clef for me let me hide myself in Thee"

You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
In the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
In the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
When I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
We've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...
One more time to escape from all this madness
One more time to be set free from all this sadness
And one last time to be the one who understands
My soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity
Foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be
Death is the destiny for all of our ways
In the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say
When I see the power of the demon come alive
You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
On the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun
Reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won

In winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...

I was striking with my fists at the heavens ceilings
Too low I fell, I did not reach the step-father's neck
Although his visage seemed so close
With bony fingers I desired to clench the crown of thorns
In vain, I have trampled the paradisical flower of love
And I trample its rights here, on the earth
Each sin - my soldier
A daemon of the several thousand strong cavalery
Not gods son I am, but the child of million stars
While each of them symbolises different human fraility greater than mine
I am the wisdom and the perfection of the universe."

This time I know there's no way back
Left alone, abandoned
Without any chance in tomorrow
You're gone forever
As I try to find a reason for this
Endlessly wondering why
You burned away all I was living for
Remembrances are all I still own of you
As I lie in my bed, drunk, confused
Flashes of our past passing before my eyes
Just like dying, endlessly dreaming of you
Dreaming of forgotten words and smiles
Trying to push away the need to harm myself
I feel is growing deep inside of me
I feel I will have to carve this pain upon my skin
Loneliness arises from the past
I will not bear this torment longer
As I try to sleep to heal this madness
But this bed now seems to be like my tomb
Now I know it's all too late to save me
I keep on dreaming of past years
I can't feel that warmth anymore
You turned my existence in a terminal disease
I know all I once called life ends today
As you disappear forever, flying far away
All emotions inside of me are dead and gone
I can't stand this silence, but now I'm alone
I'm alone
Where have you gone when I needed you?
Never again"

Shoutin dreams from the smile on our face.

Showin unity to the human race.
Our words are too far from earth we're told
To ever be any worth.
But we'll tell you for the good of your souls;
Live your dreams to find the truth.
Feet on earth, head in sky,
Heart throbs in-between.
Finger tips on waves of thought
That no man's ever seen.
So don't let fear of pain emerge
And kill us before we speak.
For we are His messengers
To give strength to the weak.
We'll carry our enchanted sticks,
We'll live in our enchanted land.
Enchanted by the touch of god
Or can't you understand.
Dream you're on a schooner
In the waters of all time.
Or in a tee-pee on the plains
Chantin all time magic rhymes

And drove Wednesday through Sunday
And sometimes played three shows a day
The modern lone rider, he dreamed of Ohio
And his doe-eyed Arabian bay
And how they'd go racing out on the hillside
In the cool closing twilight of day
Old friends together in thunderous freedom
Just the man and the wind and the bay.
Well, sometimes they'd ride down by the river
And the bay always stopped there to drink
In the still of the evening
The horse seemed contented
And the man used the time just to think.
And in the cold winds of winter
He's drawn to the barn
By some irresistable force
With carrots and a blanket
There's nothing more binding
Than the love of a man for his horse.
The call of the highway, how it would beckon
He kept going back out of course
And in the deep of the night
When the miles were the hardest
He just figured he drove for the horse.
And in all life's relations one thing stays the same
Never take more than you will repay
So we count the score even
'cause the miles he had driven
Were for miles that he rode on the bay.
They grew old together, got too old to ride
But just look at the seeds that they'd sowed
They'd walk out in the pasture, stand side by side
And stare off at the hills where they'd growed.
And of all God's creations here under heaven
There's many I can't understand
One beautiful mystery that I at least witnessed
Was the love of a horse for a man."

Bewailed upon a bed of thorns,

Wherefore betwixt two worlds I'm torn
Ere thralled by sin I'll die - forlorn

To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise"

All in a day's work, we're tumbling down
Down by the old school, trash in the street
Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet
Asking will it get better?

Over the rainbow, out in the snow

As I sit alone,
In the indecipherable darkness.

Vivacity of the wind begets clear my mind.
In eternal isolation.
Those that pretend to care,kill you,
And leave you for being dead.
I seek,for where am I?
The throes of death swirl within me,
And I smile.....
Life,raped by disease.
Cast out.
No place for me here.
I create my kingdom.
Creation through destruction,
Cut out the heart of the Christian disease.
Knowledge my fortune,
I channel the strength of my will.
The lure of the moonlight,
Streams forth,with abundance of strength.
I bask in it's essence,
Devouring the force,
Succouring my veins.
I traverse to the beckon of my desire.
Destruction.
This stagnant humanity serves only to frustrate.
Unfit to stand alone,huddled in their masses,
Synonymous in their worthless existence.
The time will come to pass.
Creation of life,
Destruction of the disease.

This little song I use to sing to my lad whose in the crowd tonight I'm going to embarrass him now when he was only a baby he is now 20 yrs old
An American landed on Erin's green isle
He gazed on killarny with a rapturous smile
How can I buy it he said to the guy
I'll tell you how with a smile he replied
How can you buy all the stars in the sky
How can you buy two Blue Irish eyes
When you can purchase a fine mothers heart
Then you can buy killarny
Nature restore on her guilt's with a smile
Me and Rose the shamrock and the barley
When you can buy all those wonderful things
Then you can buy killarny
Over in Killarny, Many years ago,
there's a song my mother sang to me
in a voice so sweet and low.
Just a simple Irish ditty,
in her sweet ould fashion way,
and I'd give the world if I could hear
that song of hers today.
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,

To the glistening star of a bible class

She was Alice through the gloryhole
An ejaculate misconception
Disney-esque, the high priestess
Of greed and deepest dark deception
All best-to-bury whims

Brer Werewolf at her stocking tops
Beneath the tightened leather strop
Of the basque of the houndervilles
At the stroke of midnight come
She polished verse and hearses
In a poisonous pen dipped in omen
To her surgeon full of general curses
In the hand of morgue redeemers
Though the dead always pleased her more
Squatting in her coffins
Flirting curtsies to the thirteenth floor
Tip your hats

Smoke and mirrors on all fours?

The final dance will be the cue

Nine candles lit to improve the gloom

Full of hidden secrets

Full of hidden secrets

So alone

So alone

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed

And a bottle of porter at his head

Do you do you like fine wine now
Don't it don't it don't it taste fine now
Can'tcha can'tcha can'tcha just hear it
Rock 'n' rock 'n' rock 'n' roll music
Get-a get-a get-a that beat now
Does it does it does it feel neat now
Will you will you will you just kizz me
When you leave me don't you just mizz me
Could we could we could we get married
Enough enough enough of goin' steady

My weary eyes followed their grotesque movements across the grey ceiling.
Desperation pervaded the dusk-filled room.
An air of depravity joined the gloom that surrounded my cadaver-like body.

I asked this night for a piece of advice
This time the scythe won't fall, keep still
You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door
Leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door
And if you follow the trails down this winter wake
She's reaping down souls, one for every flake
Throughout the ages, through centuries
She, mistress of customs of memories"

And the echoes dark between

A break-down, the last resort
It's the faces of a few
That everybody knew
Waiting in the shadows -
Your entering the streets of despair
It's a street that only goes one way
Down the narrows where the neons say
Life is only but a dream
And you're playing out a scene
Waiting in the shadows -

All I know is, God, here comes that old west wind again

Some will sweat the blazing sun and some rot in the rain
Here we got the Chinook wind a blowin' every day
It's gonna send the good dirt east and leave a terrible migraine
Let her blow, let her blow
Whisper me things that I don't know
Let her blow, let her blow
Let her blow away illusions like she melts the driftin' snow
There comes a time I stood my ground and said I've had my fill
Of that moisture sucking west wind roarin' in off them hills
Before it flew me crazy I let it carry me away
They told me, ""Son you ain't the first, that breeze will
drive a man insane""
Let her blow, let her blow
Whisper me things that I don't know
Let her blow, let her blow
Let her blow away illusions like she melts the winter snow

Staring at the distance and askin' what it takes
To make that old Chinook turn back and blow the other way
And maybe if I'm lucky have it blow me home again"

Looking back upon the early years

Waking the Demon,
Where'd ya run to
Walking in shadows,
Watch the blood flow
There's not much longer so don't try and fight,
Your body's weakening so walk to the light
All those painful times so alone so ashamed,
I'm not coming back there's nothing to gain
Breath for me,
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me,
Possession taking over
Possession taking over
Breath for me,
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me,
Possession taking over
Possession taking over

In the hour when the night falls
Voices from the dark side are calling my name
Slowly fading to the world where I belong
Ebony rising, I close my eyes
Flashing pictures of an old remembrance passing by
On obsidian wings I fly, leave the gates behind
Through the colonnades of eternity
This is the end for me, I'm dying
[chorus]
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
On black wings I fly, as I cross the dark sky
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
When daylight dies, eternally
As whispers surround me, see people I have known
Remember times I had forgotten long ago
Dark arms embrace my soul, emptiness fills my mind
As the pulse of life is slowly fading
Now a storm is rising
Then he appears
Cloaked in a robe of black
Waiting to guide my soul from here
Across the stream of life, to a kingdom beyond, back to the place of birth,
So this the end for me, I'm dying
[chorus]
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
On black wings I fly, as I cross the dark sky
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
When daylight dies, eternally
A world of silence, waits for me, the end in darkness, is my destiny
As my life passes, before my eyes, from my birth, to the time I die
From my cradle, to my grave, a little time, until the death embrace.
Now my memories fade away, the past forgotten, a new life waits for me.
Will I reincarnate, will I die forever, when I meet my fate, at the break of dawn.
Soon I will now, if there is endless darkness, or there is blazing light.
When daylight turns to night.
Eternal Silence
As my memories Fade to black
Rising darkness
And there is no turning back"

No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
No one is to smart
In affairs of the heart
Now upon the bridge she waits
Dreaming of our tangled fates
Her face was like a ghost with eyes of jade
I fell just like a falling star
A victim of this coup d'etat
I could not see behind this masquerade
From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
Be careful where you start
In affairs of the heart
Sometimes I think I'll never learn
Were all those promises in vain
Do the wings of fire still remain
All is fair in love and war
The tender draw the shortest straw
Like autumn leaves they vanish in the air
Is this the time we say good-bye
I call her room there's no reply
Tonight we end this fleeting love affair
From this fire there's no returning

And he rides with me from town to town

In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around his baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house

With the eyes of one who hates for just being born

Oh my sweet fleeting illusion
You cast my dreams away
Trough the valleys of oblivion
I wander with dismay
Can I find in disillusion

Unfolding a masquerade of grims
All hope died in myself
And thus ended the latest dream

And pulled the rug clean off of Eli's head

Where the sun shines no fear, as it burns
My resolution
To remain,
To refrain
From contending the flame, as we join
This great illusion..reappears
Disappear
Who will sing my name?
So sang the flame that gave my name (x4)
Disappear with me here
Where the sun shines no fear, as it burns
My resolution
To remain,
To refrain
From contending the flame, as we join
This great illusion..reappears
Disappear
Disappear
Oh!!!"

We'd sit around and drink black coffee
Talkin' 'bout the people we had been
We traveled through the childhood memories
You showed me scars from the bars of monkey
Smiling as your eyes reflected me
Now everything has changed
Your street, your hair, your name
My world is rearranged
'Cause everything has, everything has changed
I woke up on a winter Wednesday
I read the note that you had left me
You found another friend to help you through
For years I tried to put you under
The memories made me run for cover
I'd see your face in everything I'd do
Well, I was wrong
You never felt the same
And now you've gone
Away, away
The days of wine and roses tasted
I think of all the time I've wasted
Wanderin' through a past that could have been
I know that nothing lasts forever
Best times are the ones remembered
Thankful for the days that I have seen
Everything has changed"

(Dallas Frazier)
'67 Acuff-Rose Music, BMI
Like a raging flood that ruins a poor man's land
You keep doing things to hurt me all you can
But the thickness that we knew is growing thin
How much rain can one man stand
How much rain can one man stand
I gave you everything but my right hand
If you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friend
How much rain can one man stand
I can see them big old storm clouds movin' in
There's a stranger in your big brown eyes again
And you've told him that I'm just an old time friend
How much rain can one man stand
How much rain can one man stand...
How much rain can one man stand"

Lay in state with the sad and damned
A rent lament barely flung above a whisper
Drew Me like a ghost to the haunts of Man
I Found Her tempting fate between Her wrist and razor
A kindred spirit in a graveyard
Beneath the stature of a colder Saviour
Mist hung like thieves wreathed in scant arabesques
And through the chill earth it bedwed Her drawling breast
Like a come dream true under etched glass spent
Making love to the beautiful dead
She has sinned and severed Heaven
And in it's vulgar sight
Two figures writhe, but one silhouette
Extends it's fingers to the light
""Gothic towers tottered on Her heels
As She fled asylum grounds
Committing hard crimes to soft cells
Where now another's screams resound""
From the gaspings in Her passing
Six feet under or beneath frayed gown
When Her hands pointed to midnight
In a white stained chamber bound
I Swept Her from the abyss of another dementia
Freeing Her soul from the fetters of fate
To take the reins of pleasure
Now nightwane mirrors freeze in seizure
At the glimpse of charmed pins in Her thighs
Ballrooms filled with black cats scratch
Out of spite and playful eyes
Pricked as a Witch Her stitches itch
For familiar lips to lick them dry
Whilst the dark regrasps, for if She asks
The Sun forsakes the right to rise
And is the first to discern, that this Angel's return
Is a vengefull call on grace
For even martyrdom backs from it's suicide pacts
A leap of twisted fate betrayed
The scars will last until the stars
Caught in Her train bewitched
Fall into line and yield the sign
That Dawn in born to their eclipse
For Our In humankind
Comes an underdog day Sunrise
Rippling with fire llike femaledition
Iplintered Her coffin and lay on the floor
Of a vault with Her clasped as the moon hugs the shore
What treachery this that She breathed no more?
Christ you bastard!
I wished Her back but the dead adored Her
Even wild winds sang in chora for Her
Saffron from my heart, from the start I swore
We'd be together more
Creation froze with the triumph of Death
But still She stirred and awoke bereft
Of concern save for the aeons left
To lead the darkness
She schemes of growing power and the lengths sucked hard to get it
I dream of being God but ever living to regret it
Our fecund nature decrees that Jesus wept come for
The Devil on Her knees
To grant Her lows a remedy
And mine desire's wish
To taste thereof of Heaven's scent
As sick and twisted as it is
For Her corset laced with arsenic
Hides snake curves within Her midst
Whilst Her halo of white lies supplies
Her temple to what God forbids."

Words and Music Chris Foster
copyright 2003 Chris Foster Music Publishing
What was known as a modern day marvel
A great railroad that crossed over sea
It defied all the whitecaps and the deep coral bed
And linked the whole world to the keys
Who should take on this lofty endeavor?
But a man who they said was obsessed
Who'd made millions of dollars refining crude oil
Now his focus was on reaching Key West
Skeptics and cynics who used pens as their lances
Took cheap shots at him and asked what were the chances
That the railroad you're building make good on the quest
Of rolling over the ocean right into Key West?
The Last train to paradise
They'd dubbed Flagler's folly for the use of a knife
Undeterred by their antics Henry went on with life
And drew up the plans for the last train to paradise.
It all started when he first came to Florida
His friends told him that he should retire
You could live off your wealth till the end of your days
But inside Henry still had his fire.
He said this place aint what it could be
With the weather so nice all year round
So I'll buy up the Halifax/ Jacksonville rail
And track it south from town to town.
We'll track over rivers and track over streams
We'll track over farmland and other mans dreams
We'll track it through mangroves and track it through the fields
And were we can't track we will dredge for the fill
We'll build the last train to paradise
New towns and new hotels where the weather is nice
Right on to Fort Dallas where they suffer no ice
He continued to build the last train to paradise.
When the railroad got as far south as Homestead.
They thought Henry, had then done his best
But in the back of his brain a notion remained
To take the railroad right on to Key West.
Where Deep water awaited the liners
and shipping trades to the canal.
But what stood in his way was the great Biscayne bay
And an inlet that spanned 7 miles.
Faced with the fact that he had to cross ocean
He put all his engineers minds into motion
Devising a plan to extend the great line
By building a sea bridge one arch at a time.
The last train to paradise
Rolled over the ocean against all advice
Almost in defiance he didn't think twice
He had completed the last train to paradise.
Mother nature had dealt him some losses
Hurricanes in 0 6 9 and 10
But his vision stayed strong and he vowed to go on
In the memory of the losses men
After 7 long years to completion
He rolled south in his car 91
He enjoyed every mile with a big eager smile
Because impossible things had been done
And the skeptics and cynics who had used pens as their lances
Were in awe of the man who had met their advances
Henry answered all questions and passed all the test
When the conductor yelled now arriving key west
The last train to paradise
Built with muscle and sweat and a vision precise
Unparalleled by what he accomplished in life
A divine inspiration. The Last train to paradise"

But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped
As if trying to think of something but having no luck
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair
I said, ""Johnny where's your cranium?"" but he didn't seem to know
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead
Refusing to believe that he had split for good
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad
Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body
(I ain't got nobody)
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face"

Delusions of Grandier denounced the revolt
Of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
Encircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult
With hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds
To Archangels in bondage
From light to night hurled
Cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......
But soon,
Her tarot proved
Hybrid rumours spread like tumours
Would accrue
And blight Her stars
To better bitter truths
Of cold bloodbaths
As bodies rose
In rigid droves
To haunt Her from their
Shallow burials imposed
When wolves exhumed
Their carthen wombs
Where heavy frosts had laboured long
To bare their wounds
To the depths of Her soul they pursued
Wielding their poison they flew
Like a murder of ravens in fugue
And knowing their raptures
Would shatter Her dreams
She clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
Baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies
So Hallow's Eve
As She received
Like Bellona to the ball
Those enemies
Fell-sisters heaved
Her torturies
Cross stained flagstones
To Her carriage reined to flee
But She knew She must brave the night through
Though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
Like a murder of ravens in Fugue
For each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
Horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
And even Her dance
In the vast mirrors cast
Looked the ill of Her future

He clocked the doctor cause the doctor said I looked like Chewbacca
The doctor said sir you're misled sir which infers you mistook me
I did not mean your lovely wife was shackin' up with a wookie
What I mean is Wolverine is less hairy than your son
He's looks like Chewie Baba Booey Baba Booey and a Hong Kong Phooey all in one
To put it mild your new-born child's completely nutty fu-fu lookin'
I'd shove him back into the oven until he is done cookin'
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause my fifteen-year-old cousin has less acne
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
Ain't brushed them teeth since 1983
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause you've got the grooming habits of a chimpanzee
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause you're white but got a nose like Bill Cosby
Why's everbody always pickin' on me?
Always pickin' and rippin' apart poor ol' Jimmy Pop Ali
I got a schnoz like the ''cause' but there's a lot more wrong with you
So back me up Bill yea and you're ugly too
So what if I brush my teeth with a piece of cheddar cheese
Or where a fish net shirt by Chams with my Sergio Valenti jeans
And my mirror never lies but it always verifies
I got more cheese and pepperoni than a homemade pizza pie
You compare me to a Monchichi but I don't understand
Why I'm scorned like I'm deformed like the Elephant Man
And yea I took my mom to the prom but hey she asked me first
But at least this time I didn't find my date in the back of a hearse
About as popular with the girls with Englebert Humperdink
And that might be 'cause everybody calls me Shrinky Dink
I know I'm known as Polaroid I'm not a total retard
It's cause I'm done in sixty seconds and you'll still want it enlarged
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
Cause ya wore velour flares until the late Eighties
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause you run like a girl and sit down to pee
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause your only school chum was the lunch lady
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
You took your mom to the prom but got lucky
Like that episode where Gilligan gets sick of being teased
And he breaks into the Professor's lab and makes some LSD
Peaks freaks and eats the Skipper's brains then beats Ginger with coconuts
As Mr. Howell and Lovey burn alive inside their grass hut

And like a postal clerk I'll go beserk if you don't stop teasing me

Step by step I enter the void
Smile to the silence around me
Trough my nostrils I contain my rhyme
For mere own taste
different shape and dimmension , distorted visions
and real perception
Someone wants me to fly
Impossible alternative, I finish my path
Tender and the past Acompany my victory
Why I burden
They suck the air delicatly from me
This smile , this scent , do you fill, to your lungs?
They steal my oxygen
Only in the void I can rest
Step by step I enter the void
Smile to the silence around me
Trough my nostrils I contain my rhyme
For mere own taste
Different shape and dimmension
Distorted visions and re-up perceptions
Someone wants me to fly"

O growing Moon, didst thou but shine
A last time on this pain of mine
Behind this desk how oft have I
At midnight seen thee rising high
O'er book and paper I bend
Thou didst appear, o mournful friend
[Mephistopheles:]
I am the spirit that ever denies!
And justly so: for all that is born
Deserves to be destroyed in scorn
Therefore 'twere best if nothing were created
Destruction, sin, wickedness - plainly stated
All of which you as evil have classified
That is my element - there I abide

From the Heavens, to the World, to Hell!
The World of Spirits is not barred to thee!
[Mephistopheles:] ""Now then, Faustus. What wouldst thou have Mephisto do?""
[Faust:]
""I charge thee, Mephisto, wait upon me while I live... to do whatever Faustus shall command. Be it to make the moon drop from outer sphere, or the ocean to overwhelm the world. Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer: say he surrenders up his soul. So that he shall spare him four and twenty years, letting him live in all voluptiousness, having thee ever to attend on me. To give me whatsoever I shall ask.""
[Mephistopheles:] ""I will.""
[Faust:]
Sublime spirit, thou hast given me all
All for which I besought thee, not in vain
Didst thou reveal thy countenance in the fire
Thou hast given me Nature for a kingdom
With the power to enjoy and feel
Only a visit of chilling bewilderment
Thou [then me?] bringest all the living creatures
And taught me to know my brothers in the Air
In the deep waters and in the silent coverts
When through the forest the storm rages
Uprooting the giant pines which in their fall
Crushing, drag down neighboring boughs and trunks
Whose [growingly?] hollow thunder shake the hills
Then thou dost lead me to a sheltering cave
And revealest me to myself and layest bare
The deep mysterious miracle of my Nature
And when the pure moon rises into sight
Soothingly above me, then about me hover
Creeping from rocky walls and dewy thickets
Silver shadows, phantoms of a bygone world
Which allay the austere joy of meditation
Now fully do I realize that Man
Can never possess perfection
With this ecstasy which brings me near and nearer
To the Gods
[Margarete: ]
My mother the harlot put me to death
My father the scoundrel ate my flesh
My dear little sister laid all my bones
In a dark shaded place under the stones
Then I changed into a wood-bird
Fluttering away
Fly away
[Mephistopheles:]
Mankind, that foolish Cosmos
Always acts as incomplete
He thought himself to Be
I am part of that part which was the Absolute
A part of that Darkness which gave birth to Light
The arrogant Light which would dispute
Ancient rank of Mother Night
Therefore I hope it won't be long before
With matter it shall perish evermore!

[Mephistopheles:] ""The governing force? The reason? Some things cannot be known; they are beyond your reach even when shown.""
[Faust:] ""Why should that be so?""
[Mephistopheles:] ""They lie outside the boundaries that words can address; and man can only grasp those thoughts which language can express.""
[Faust:] ""What? Do you mean that words are greater yet than man?""
[Mephistopheles:] ""Indeed they are.""
[Faust:] ""Then what of longing? Affection, pain or grief? I can't describe these, yet I know they are in my breast. What are they?""""

When she stole my heart under a desert moon
In a bordertown down in Mexico, where all the lonely cowboys go
Stands a mission church at the end of a crowded street
Was there I first caught sight of her alone, my heart began to stir
She was kneeling there at the foot of a painted cross
On the borderline,
Crossing the heartlands again and again
On the borderline,
If lightning would strike me, I'd never know when
My heart must always remain on the borderline
Had to stay another day if only just to find a way to meet that girl who prays by the lonesome grave
They say she lost her only one to a battle of the blazing guns
Now she cries each night and her tears stain the desert sand
She vowed to never give her heart to someone else if they should part
I'll never meet those eyes to tell her I love her so
I'm on the borderline
Crossing the heartlands again and again
On the borderline
If lightning would strike me I'd never know when

You think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you.
I think you're insensitive and I don't feel heard.
And I said do you believe we are fundamentally judgmental?
Fundamentally evil?
And you said yes.
And I said do you believe in revenge, in right or wrong, good or bad?
And you said well, what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency
Room,
Bleeding after beating his kid, and she threw a shoe at his head.

Compassion for him.

Asi que no puedes ms

Asi que dime de q' sirve soar
Si no puedes dar
Ni un paso adelante
Mira como ests
Asi q' suelta el miedo djalo
Un poco de riesgo
Nos vendra muy bien
Recuerda, no ests vencida
Hasta que te rindas
No hay problema, no hay dilema
Sigue la carrera
Si corres, vuela, si duermes, suea
Salta la marea
No ests vencida
Algunas veces me ha faltado color
Y me ha cegado la luz
Y estuve a punto de perecer
No ests vencida
Despus si te sientes mejor
Busca bien en tu interior
Alguna piedra azul
Algn secreto gris
No te aflijas, no te rindas
Ponte en pi
Ya q' no ests vencida
Y si algn deseo te hace sonreir
Y si un sueo oculto te hace sonrojar
Recuerda no ests vencida
Tomate un tiempo
Sultate el pelo
Suelta si quieres por ah tu amor
No estas vencida
Si estas lista para hacer
Lo que nunca me dijiste
Ni pensaste hacer
Me tienes q' enfrentar
Luego provocar
Nunca ms ds un paso atrs
Dices q'stas lista pa'sentir placer
Entonces un poco de amor
Nos vendra bien
No estas vencida

Where'd you get that vibration
Did you buy it from a dealer,
Did you get it from a healer,
Or did you steal it from my imagination
Well you can take what you need
Tabitha it's not me;
It comes from the well-spring swing
Ask the girl in the green tee
Why else she'd want to keep it
'til her dying day
I got a fever from believing
Slow down
Got a head full of fire
Rebound
Can't fight with desire
Slow down
I guess i'm going to get, get
Low down
Where'd you get that vibe?
Tabitha's got the hollywood smile
Thinks that smile's gonna take her
To the nile river to deliver
A vibration high as the sky is wide
She just bought a black cadillac, well
Freedom is believin' you can never look back
To the vibe
Whether strong whether weak
Whether low
Where it takes you
You can never go
So fine, so fine
Oh, yes it is, lord
So fine, so fine
So fine i blew my fuckin mind
So fine, so fine
Generation x
When you meet your maker
Will you ask for a list
Of the one of the two
Of the three of the four
Vibrations
You can add to your fix
And tabitha blue
Will you ever be alive?
Spent your life chasin' after
Other people's vibes
Stuck with the dealer
Or lost with the healer
Will you make it to
Your dying day?"

Burning me straight, keeping me cold

Most view it with fear and trepidation, but that's not the way for me, oh no
On a day like no other
I welcome death, I welcome the reapers icy embrace
His cold damp cloak as it scrapes against my skin
And because this day will come but once in your entire life
It should be a truly magnificent event
Something to be remembered for all eternity
You want people to gather, you want people to lament
The severity of your final moments on this earth
For this is more than significant this event, this is forever
When I die, I wanna die violently
What could be more mundane than dying of old age
Or of natural causes when there's death by misadventure to be pursued?
Any idiot can die, but it takes someone truly special to go out
In what I'd call a spectacular kind of way
Ripped apart by sharks, torn to bits by wolves
Tortured beyond the threshold of human tolerance
And don't fear the reaper when the game is over and your number is up
For death my friends, yes death is inevitable!
When I die, I wanna die violently, when I die I hope that I'll suffer
Burnt out and cut up and dealt out and fucked up
When I die, I pray my exit's gonna be fucking bleak when I die I wanna be in pain
In a vicious and inhumane sorta way to the very hilt of human suffering
With fear and loathing racing through my veins"

A darkened sky and the loss of worth.
Lower me down under glorious green.
Eternity waits on a broken machine.
Exit the soul in a vibrant white.
Leaving the shell in the dead of night.
Life is a path, Death a destination.
I've met the end of being, my eyes are open wide.
I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die.
A step to the throne, I stand alone.
A vacant mind and a destined home.
Engaging the end in a seamless gaze.
Like blind I climb through the tortured blaze.
Raise me up into white unstained eternity gained, only life remains.
Forever the scars have been washed away
Like blood on the brow of a forgotten day.
Life is a path, Death a destination.

Was it everything you wanted?
Was it everything you thought it'd be?

(Bill Anderson - Steve Wariner)
'99 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
Our weekend in Atlanta was a total disaster
We argued and you caught the first plane home
We made up and went to Memphis but there wasn't any difference
We were there together but alone
So we tried a beach in Texas a casino in Las Vegas
Once we even tried Niagra Falls
But your world and mine collided and one day you decided
We weren't made for each other after all
But I'll always have Denver and that summer to remember
Moonlight in the Rockies and starlight in your eyes
On a mountain top together we pledged our love forever
There's nothing that could ever take from me what I remember
I'll always have Denver
How could a love so warm and tender grow so cold and bitter
How could all I gave not be enough
Staring at the ceiling it's a painful empty feeling
I don't have you I don't have your love
But I'll always have Denver..."

Here I stand, I will make this work, breaking every barricade
Never again will I let it go, a lesson learned, a progress made
Killing me, that's all it wants to do
Killing you, hear my words, they are meant for you
I resent life, as I was given it
You can't heal something that's meant to be broken

And my sister was saved
Singing sinners come and repent of your sins
There the angels were crowded and the sisters would shout out
And the bread was saved amen
It was there I met Jesus and gave him my life
It was there he took the weight off my load
And he freely removed all my sorrow and strife
In that little old church by the road
I remember the preacher so gentle and brave
As he told how the father above
Gave his only son Jesus all the lost ones to save
Such wonderful wonderful love
I will always remember when the preacher would say
Come to Jesus he'll lighten your load
So often he preached of the life giving bread
In that little old church by the road

I could never forget all those lovely old songs
That the people so joyfully sang
How they told the Lord's message to sinners gone wrong

He was in a bind, ten payments behind so the bank repoed his wheels.
When he came across this old man down at Jalopy's Used Car lot.
Then Cledus jumped up on the top of one and said:
""Fella, let me tell you what.""
""I'm not gonna be proud of the deed I'm 'bout to do.
""With no time to spare, I gotta be somewhere,
""So I'm gonna steal a car from you.

""I know the Pinto's gold but consider it stoled,
""''cause I got a show to do. ""
The man said: 'My name's Jalopy,"" as he gave an evil grin.
''cause he knew that car wouldn't get too far 'fore the motor blew up again.
Cledus, you better hit the road if you're gonna be a star.
The show's way up in Georgia and you're opening up for Garth.
Your future's riding on this shiny Pinto painted gold.
And if you're late, it's Jeff Foxworthy's show.
Oh, gosh a Pinto, my foot. It drives more like a horse and buggy. Durn.
Cledus said: ""No way in heck you're gonna open up that show.""
Then fire flew from the manifold as his right front tyre blowed.
And he pushed that wreck across the street and man was Cledus tissed.
And he tried and tried to start her up but it sounded something like this.
Come on. Come on.
Oh Gawd, I'm in a mess what am I gonna do.
My one big shot for Garth Brooks .
Oh durn it.
When Cledus opened up the hood he said: 'I'll be a son of a gun'.
And didn't long to figure out why the heck it wouldn't run.
Fire from the engine, lots of smoke.
He can already hear them redneck jokes.
Dead blamed oil pan laying in the road.
Will he make the show, heck no, heck no.
Whoa oh.
Taxi! Greyhound! Yellow cab! Somebody!
I'll show him a redneck.
He'll have a redneck when I get my hands around his throat.
I'm sick of it.
Cledus shook his head as he watched Foxworthy's show.
And he heard him joke of how he passed a burning gold Pinto.
Then later on, Garth told Cledus: ""you'll never get the chance again,""
As he gave the check to that durned redneck who drove a Mercedes Benz.
He said: ""Tough break, big guy.
""Before I go would you like to hear another redneck joke'
""Did you know I got my own TV show'""
Well, does anybody watch it' (No, heck, no.)
Well, you might be a redneck if your mom and daddy cathes you out behind the barn.
Whupping Jeff Foxworthy for talking about rednecks all the time.
Aw, shoot I'm just kidding, Jeff.

To find what she was looking for
To identify, to really try
To find herself some hope
With the summer sun for laughing
And the winter rain did pour
She was lovelier from learning
And from living, loving more
From her dancing love and young soul
And the gypsies in her dream
To the pulse of stark acceptance
When the winds began to freeze
With no curfews left to hold her
And no walls to shield her pain
Finding out that facts were older
And that life forms are insane.
The presence of protection seemed
To fade, as did her doubt
That she now was no exception
Nor was the love who pushed her out
Though the streets cried out,
Go, homesick
Virtues strength of mind would ring
In the maladies of meaning
The sad song she learned to sing.
Now, her teachers and philosophers
And the poet's silver throat
Are the vessels which on wisdom's karmic ocean she will float.
Was this her revolution,
Just a child in love's crusade,
With the question in her innocence
Through the lies her eyes betrayed?"

To wash away the sins of mankind
Leaving no traces of life

The price of wealth was too high to pay
Disaster struck over opulence
Gone was all that glory
And bale was total
The prophecy was true
Thus it came to fulfill
Now return, return to the sea
So many men gave up to the sea
It washed away their pride
Greed, vanity, shallowness
Rectified by waves
Now the city rests in peace
In a cold lonely tomb
In the depths of sea
Aeons of wealth came to end
Into sea they descent

It swept the land in an uncontrolled
outburst
Famine, cold and pestilential misery
Surely this must be a divine damnation
Punishment from below
Be it devil or demon that reaps this
cursed nation
No one of us deserves suffering thus
Oh lord, what have we done
Oh God, have you forsaken us?
I ride the night air
On pestilential wings
I am the nightmare
That slays your kith and kin
I ride your bed at night
An incubus so vile
My work is seen throughout
The smoke of funeral pyres
Black rats do my work
Punishment begins
Cover your face, everyone has heard
Here is payment for your sins
This epoch you won't forget
You're burning from inside
In the final throes of horrid death
The proudest men forget their pride
They cry in pain immense
Praying to be spared
But your god seems not to care
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
All are prey alike
Twitching in rotten bowel runs
I crave a heavy toll
The deadringers sound the bell
For all of you who fell
I reap the field in rage
You scream in mindless fear
When gripped in my embrace
I purify, you putrefy, the end I provide
For your blasphemy, I bring you
disease, a funeral feast
I take the helm and steer you into, a
hellish domain
You fall in the streets, succumb in
your sheets, diabolic disease
And you don't know why
Why your children die
And you won't know why
On winds of death I ride
Now summer has come over
the city
Midday heat is low
The surviving few bring out
their dead
A neverending flow...
I am the death, upon your black
breath, I am black death
I am the reason, that children lie
crying, watching their parents
dying
And I am formless, always
relentless, something you
cannot see
And I am evil, I am disaster, I am
catastrophe
By the end of 1352, two thirds
are gone
A horrible tale of pestilence and
plague, darkness and woe
Now I subside, slowly die out,
yet I have won
But I will return, in futures to
come, in different forms

You should've seen the spring in his step, as he ran to show his dad

Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore
And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride
Or I'd cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side
On the morning we parted, how sad the farewell
Our words, they were few, but our thoughts none could tell
And when lost to my vision far over the brine
I drank your success in a goblet of wine
Three times have I crossed to the ship as she lay
Becalmed on the breast of the silvery bay
And my crew are the bravest ever handled an oar
And not by the tempest, they laugh at its roar
No ballroom can tempt me nor raise my dispair
For there none in the dance that with you can compare
And to watch the young lovers as they swing 'round the floor
Brings tears to these eyes that may see you no more
And in beauty there's none with this lady could buy
She's as pure as the stars and the blue of the sky
She's as fair as a lily and as sweet as a rose
And there's nothing can tempt me, her name to disclose
No drink will I take for to lighten my heart
But the wildest adventures I'll take for my part
No women on earth will I have for a bride
'Til I cross the wild Atlantic to be your side
Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore

And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride

Instead he was enslaved
In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee
Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die
He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes
His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
""Shut him up and hang him high!""
As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: ""There is a God""
The sound of eight hooves reaches his ears
Comes from the heavenly light
Two wolves' howls fill his heart with fear
And he sees two ravens fly
Down from the sky a warlord rides
Like fire his one eye glows
And just before the preacher dies
He knows his god is false"

I spiered at him, what was the news
Quo' he, ""The Highland army rues
That ever we came to Cromdale""
""We were in bed, sir, every man
When the English host upon us came
A bloody battle then began
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale""
""The English horse, they were so rude
They bathed their hoofs in Highland blood
But our brave clans, they boldly stood
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale""
""But, alas, we could no longer stay
For over the hills we came away
And sore we do lament the day
That ever we came to Cromdale""
Thus the great Montrose did say
""Can you direct the nearest way?
For I will over the hills this day
And view the Haughs of Cromdale""
""Alas, niy, Lord, you're not so strong
You scarcely have two thousand men
And there's twenty-thousand on the plane
Stand rank and file on Cromdale""
Thus the great Montrose did say
""I say, direct the nearest way
For I will over the hills this day
And see the Haughs of Cromdale""
They were at dinner, every man
When the great Montrose upon them came
A second battle then began
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The Grant, Mackenzie and M'Ky
Soon as Montrose they did espy
Oh, then they fought most valiantly
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The M'Donalds, they returned again
The Camerons did their standard join
M'Intosh played a bloody game
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The M'Gregors fought like lions bold
M'Phersons, none could them control
M'Lauchlins fought like loyal souls
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
M'Leans, M'Dougals and M'Neils
So boldly as they took the field
And made their enemies to yield
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The Gordons boldly did advance
The Frasers fought with sword and lance
The Grahams they made the heads to dance
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The loyal Stewarts with Montrose
So boldly set upon their foes
And brought them down with Highland blows
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
Of twenty thousand Cromwell's men
Five hundred fled to Aberdeen
The rest of them lie on the plain

Till you no longer care
You can let go now
It's not right for me
To cling to you
Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be

To hold somebody down

Almost never came down
Only to land
Where no love is found

Rolling along in a single file
Like a slow moving train
It rumbled down out of the mist
Into the early morning light
Said they stay till the job was
Finished if it took them till midnight
There were cats and scrapers
All caterpillars packed up by mile high crane
And it looked like monsters from the old
B movies the drive-ins use to play
And we'd sang goodbye Saturday
Under the stars, wake up little Suzy
In my daddy's car
So many memories, got lost and found
When a piece of history hit the ground
The day they tore the last drive-in down
Memories thick as the smoke clouds
They made man and machine became one
Boards snapped like toothpicks
On their blades but to us it sounded like guns
Cowboys soldiers gangsters and thieves
James Bond and his golden girls
Well you could sit in your car
And never turn the key and go
Half way around the world
And it stood like a landmark for forty years
We never thought we'd live to see
It fall it to the ground and then
Just disappear like so many childhood dreams
And we'd sang goodbye
A lot of the drivers had tears in their eyes
But I don't think it was just the dust
See I still believe there's a little piece
Of that old drive-in left in all of us
Nobody moved through what seemed like hours
And slow motion it came tumbling down
We just stood there with a taste of metal
In our mouths and a silence all around
The day they tore the last drive-in down

Armanda Gilbraith I'd soon call my wife
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month's later I'd taken Tom's life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next mornin'
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor Mother stood weepin'
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was ""Willy God bless you""
Was ""Willy God bless you God bless you goodbye""

You huddled on the step
There were shadows in the alcove
We were way out of our depth
There was thunder in the hallway
There was lightning at the gate
Electric storms flashed through the walls
In fixed and fluid states
And crucified me
Do you see
That you crucify me
Now and then I call your name
And now and then it's clear
Baby you can call in vain
Even though you're near
You were cloaked in your depression
Like a widow in her veils

You swore I knew everything

Faceless watchers that stalk the carpeted corridors of whitehall

Into damnation to eliminate those who would trespass

But remember monday's signings when from door to door you dash
On the news a nation mourns your unknown soldier count the cost

That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood
Where any office boy or young mechanic
Can be a panic, with just a good looking pan
Where any barmaid can be a star maid
If she dances with or without a fan
Hooray for Hollywood
Where you're terrific, if you're even good
Where anyone at all from TV's Lassie
To Monroe's chassis is equally understood
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck
Hooray for Hollywood
Hooray for Hollywood
That phoney, super coney Hollywood
They come from Chillicothes and Padukahs
With their bazookas to get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbons and legs in tights

But if you think that you can an actor
See Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey look good
With a half an hour, you'll look like Tyrone Power

Children are born with trust in their eyes
It's the first thing that we betray
Children are born believing in magic
It's the first thing we take away
Fill them with doubt instead of magic
And fear instead of trust
And after awhile, they're just like us
On this earth there is a city
In a rich green pleasant country
Where they kill their children
The children of the streets
Free enterprise extermination
Why waste rehabilitation?
A bullet is forever
It's so final quick and cheap
And the despots all wear policemen's badges
Kill to supplement their wages
Earn their bloody bounty
With the gun and the club and knife
While profit-conscious businessmen
Upright solid citizens
Pay them a cew cruzeiros
For every murdered street kids life
(But they're children!)
They're garbage on the streets
(Oh the children!)
They're beggars, whores and thieves
(Oh pity the children!)
Cry pity if you will,
There's none on the streets
Of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil
To bless this piece of paradise
High on a hill stands Jesus Christ
Gazing down with sightless eyes
At the daily blasphemy
A mocking marble coontradiction
Arms spread wide in benediction
Suffer the little children,
Suffer them to come to me
And the despots cry ""amen, amen""
While they bow their knees to Bethlehem
They spit in the face of humankind
Turn our dreams to worthless dust
And the future, as it's always done,
Stares down the barrel of a gun
Which once more begs the question,
When will the despots come for us?
(But they're children!)
Have you seen their eyes?
(Oh the children!)
Hard and wary and street-wise
(Oh pity the children!)
There are no children here
Only old eyes full of hunger
And hate and hopeless fear
(But they're children!)
Abandoned and forsaken
(Oh the children!)
Useless human flotsam
(Oh pity the children!)
And pity us as well
For in our children's' eyes
We see mirrors of ourselves"

Please murder
My face was watching braille dogs
Hammering out belonging to the sky
Their wings form shutters
From Alan's window
The incense drifts past the skins and shells
Ruby waves goodbye
And runs to the valleys
That are beautiful
And drenched with rain and colours
And green was that blood then
The sap of monsoons and butterflies
When I was small the red flowers opened
And I broke letters and dreamed
Or murder and nations and Crowley's jazz
4 or 5 decades later
I am some Egyptian face
Was I in Luxor carving my name?
Was I binding cats with kindness and saws?
The green glass stinks with ash
In the broken windows
Remembered bodies
Fill the streets with novels
And the brave boys pass by
In brave pontoons
And mark graves
With pebbles that sink and shriek jingles
What was the lie in your showboat?
Or your slowboat? Were the paperweights
Calling you to statis? Or murder?
Was your soul at KostKutters or Kwiksavers?
The cats lie under pink lights
And see themselves as ponies with fur
Whilst Judas arises 4 centuries too late
And says ecce homo an
I was not the creator at the dawn or evening
But the trains walk by to Toytown
And call for fares from the wooden front
You and I were walking the calypso
Howling for teatime
At teatime the conquistadors and matadors
Are salvators and astronauts
The sea was bloody red and coupled with fury
Anyway murder they say
Anyway murder"

Ahiling a black sun with ebon rays,
Hailing a black moon as onyx agleam,
The dark horn sounds 'cross the nighted vale,
Shadows call in this bleak winter's dream.
I seize the throne round dagon's stone,
Dark hordes arise 'neath winter skies,
Forged 'neath the moon, by skulthur's tomb,
Blood-oath sealed, by frost-veiled steel.
White flames dancing on the snow,
The witch-fire gleams through northern skies,
The frost of heather upon her tongue,
Whispering dreams of atlantean spires,
Ruby lipped, midnight tressed, eyes as black as raven's wing,
Flesh so pale as dawn-frost gleaming,
Kisses sweet like moon-dew's tears.
Deep within the glacial ice-veiled temple,
Ancient enchantments
Summon the shades of the dreaming serpent kings...
And the ophidian throne once again draws
Power from the moon-shrouded crystal...
Mystic steel is anointed by the crimson wine of battle,
And blood reddens the gleaming snow.
Storm-borne bride of winter's fire,
Serpent-witch of the whispering fens,
Veils of scarlet and sable,
Blood spilled in the vault of night,
Frost-garlanded, the mind-binding glimmer
Of tear-filled ophidian eyes,
The gleam of winter moonlight upon black waters,
Nighted spells of the enchantress.

Skulls lie on the black altar
All crosses turned
Green blood drops from the walls
Demoniac monsters grin at me
All over signs of the evil
A man with a black coat floats over me
Glowin' eyes stare in the distance
Total calm the figure raise the voice
Our master is angry
We must appease him

Panic takes me I run to the gate it's open
Nobody stops my rout

A phantom floats over me

So, gradually we fall
United just enough, to stand each other down

Now we're in the abyss
Tearing back these walls to find nothing at all

Content to retreat
Content to hide in your safe place

And mourn the casualties
Look at the wreckage
And understand what it means
When the walls collapse
Your will to fight has been surpassed
You're on your knees again
Sift through the layers
The shattered remains of your broken dreams
The life you once longed for
Face up to devastation
Ignore the urge to hide
Seek revelation
Inspired in all the anguish
Recount the cost
Knowledge through suffering
No easy lessons
Are learned when you cross the valley
When the walls collapse
Your will to fight has been surpassed
You're on your knees again
Sift through the layers

The life you once longed for
Draw out a hard line
(You've got to follow the hard line)
A marker that shows the way
And through this draw out a hard line
A future that can't be seen from where you are

Has been surpassed

There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick.
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes
Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night
Or if his bones weren't feeling right
Or if it looked like it was going to rain
He had a tendency of being late for work
And everyone around thought he was a jerk
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt
Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan

Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike!
Mike: What, what is it?
Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work.
Mike: Awww, already?
Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes?
Mike: No.
Mike's dad: Oh.
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough
Then go home and take a little nap
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son
He just hung around and bothered everyone
Never drove a spike, not a single one
Though now and then he'd give a tap
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE!
Mike: What? What is it?
Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails faster than any man alive.
Mike: Sounds like a good idea.
Mike's dad: No! No! No!
Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster.
Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs. You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong!
Mike: Okay.
So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!)
He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!)
He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!)
Then he got crushed by a meteor and died

Some just want to play guitar in some rock 'n roll band
And in my high school the seniors just can't wait for June
They don't realize that we grow up way too soon"

I knew something was the matter
It really needed my attention
And I had planned to look into it someday
But I was busy making money
I wanted you to be proud of me
Now I wish I could turn the clock back someway
I thought there was time
I never thought that you would leave me
I always thought that I could find you
Somewhere near a phone to answer when I call
Now you have my full attention
Now you're all that I can think of
This is not what I expected at all
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
Are you even on this planet
Can you see these pretty flowers
Or am I standing here just talking to the wind
How I wish that I had told you
How I wish that I had shouted
I love you I love you I love you I love you back then
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time

I'm growing stronger with time
Some never had a chance
Their lives were taken away
Everything they had
They stood the true test of faith
And I won't back down
I'll go from where they left off

Too blunt your knife

But the world is broken
'Cause I want something
Something all wrong done
A life instead of mere living
Folding crumbling withering oh hell
What difference when working the way
The crown of my work
Is what I shall gain
At the end of my days
Daylight awake to a puppet world
No strings attach to this body of mine
Folding crumbling withering oh well

And sometimes when it gets bad
I've been known to crawl
Freedom from sorrow

I'll escape for a short time

Made in america
Nineten fifteen nine
Born down by the factories
Cross the jersey city line
Raised on radio
Just a jukebox kid
I was alright
Just a small town homeboy
With big time dreams
Foollowing his conscience
In a world full of extremes
Fresh outta high school
Only seventeen
I was alright
Blinded by my vision
There ws just no turning back
Lika a runaway train
Life was steaming down the track
You'd say I'd never make it out
But I kept on hanging on
Every night I prayed to jesus
And held my head up strong
I was alright
I landed on my feet
Made in america
I was brought up on the street
My old man's independence
Seemed good enough for me
I was made in america
Made in america
Never cared much about politics
Til I was twenty one
But I woke up when lennon
Found the wrong end of a gun
He left his inspiration
Before he said boodbye
And we were alright
We all lose out innocence
It's impossible to hold
I didn't know it then
I had a packet full of gold
When I kissed those younger days goodbye
It almost broke my heart
I was going to ghrough my growing pains
I was driving in the dark
But I was alright
I landed on my feet
Made in america
I was brought up on the street
I'm facing up to freedom
And chacing down my dream
I was made in america
Yeah I was made in america
Yeah we all lose our innocence
It's impossible to hold
I just didn't know it then
I had a packet full of gold
When they said I'd never make it
I just kept on hanging on
And every night I prayed to jesus
And I held my head up strong
And I was alright

Facing up to who I am
Chasing down my dream

Lucifer:
Oh angel o' my winter;
Grieveth for the pain o' sadness.
A gothic embrace restores my love
God took away...
Ye romance o' forgotten times...
In eras without the sun.
An ocean o' tears I see...
A nightfall o' dreams caresses me.
Deliah:
Thou wert, thou art, thou shalt fore'er be...
Ye nightshade o' thy sorrow,
Stretching out for it's romantic rose in twilights beauty.
In love with ye thousands o' nights...
But weeping in silence... in ebony... for melancholyÃ¢?Â¦ forever!
Jesus Christ walks the EarthÃ¢?Â¦
A pitiful shade of GodÃ¢?Â¦
A cruel conspiracy for the sake of slavery,
And He drags 'em down to the plague of humanity.
Lucifer:
I've killed my holinessÃ¢?Â¦
Killed my emptiness!
I'm fallen from GodÃ¢?Â¦
Fallen from guilt!
I've abandoned the light,
The light that blinded so long!
Free from submission,
But still under His spell.
We're in painÃ¢?Â¦ painÃ¢?Â¦ pain!
Sorrow turns to anguishÃ¢?Â¦
And I scream with hate at the tyrant above!
Deliah:
Hosanna de Profundis!
Dethrone the tyrantÃ¢?Â¦
Take his throne, take the throne!
Astaroth:
Gothic moonÃ¢?Â¦ ablazeth the eventide so sonorous,
Ye solemn of a lovelorn gard'n o' crimson souls.
All true beauty is sad...
But lost within the clenched hands of God.
Lucifer:
I mourn that the night passes us byÃ¢?Â¦
Let there be an eternal nightÃ¢?Â¦ eternal night!
I mourn that the night passes us by!
Let there be an eternal nightÃ¢?Â¦ eternal night!

And he's a guitar local hero and he sings straight from the heart
And his tip jar just a jungle of worn old dollar bills
He makes his rent and grocery in the local bar and grill

When he starts to sing the songs he wrote wells there's magic in the air

You took from me everything I had, in the war on your behalf

My joy turned to sorrow, since you will not return from death
One of your wisdom and understanding was not easy to find
And not one stood at Culloden, of your appearance and bravery."

And walked out towards that just rising sun

Pounding down on the red dirt like it was a drum
He walked up against me as if to convince me
His heart was easily tamed

With a handful of mane

On that shadow that cut through the fields

Stars send me astray
Walking the night without you
Blind in sight without you

Searching for songs without you
Moon so cold without you
Longing to be near
Straining to hear

Walking the stars without you

It's reeling in the heart
The sound of the pipes on the wind
The strains of the song
Carry me along
Sending me dancing again
From above and below

And the music's flowing through me like before
And the song that we once knew
Brings me back to you

Together we sleep, slouched discolored porcelain
Dreaming of those elucid moments when smiles hang high
Limbs outstretched, a bad moon rising

Drowning in what we've become

Hm, hope this ain't a party line.

Thought I'd have a late night snack
So I headed to the kitchen on a commercial break
When sup'm called me back
It was the sexiest voice that I'd ever heard
Comin' out of my television set
Said, ""Call now, you can hear me live
And I'll tell ya 'bout my naughtiness.""
So without hesitation or further ado
I grabbed a hold of my Visa
And dialed the number flashin' on my screen

So I kicked back the recliner
And on the second ring
She whispered, ""Hello. This is Sheila.
Your credit card number, please.""
I said, ""How much will it cost
For this here trip to paradise?""
She said, ""You can't put a price on love""
That's another $4.98 minute went bye
After an hour of conversation
She had me chewin' on the receiver
Well, I worked up a sweat, I's out of breath

1-900-SHEILA
Like a man possessed I dialed her number
Mornin' noon and night
And slowly but surely we fell in love
As my phone bill shot out of sight
After so many costly heart to hearts
I just had to meet her face to face
She wouldn't give me her home address
So I had her number traced. He-he.
Well, I thought it'd lead to a passion palace
Some penthouse in the sky
And, I must admit I was a little let down
When I found her in a double wide
A double wide?
That beauty that I envisioned
That goddess that drove me crazy
Answered the door with a cigar in her mouth
And weighin' in at over two eighty. He-he-ho!
They say love conquers all, well I reckon it's true
Even when it's for a fee
We said I do, and now were one
Though she makes two of me
And she talks to me no charge
Every time she takes a breather
And I'll never have to work
As long as all you jerks dial

And all the people wave their arms
But you can't hear them screaming
You're floating through the ceiling
