The way you speak... the way I move
So seek all you want, you'll never catch me
Jesting the hare and consuming the feast
I will shake the earth
Oh we are sly sly foxes but this love will find us where we hide
This love will find us where we hide

Be still for the lion and lamb will lay as one

On a little sad street, just a little run down
Became a home, for Bill and Sue
Two newlyweds, who did the best that they could do
And when they brush each other, passin' in the hall
Sue would smile and say, ""This place is pretty small""
""But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this""
Before too long, Sue and Bill
Were makin' plans, for Jack and Jill
Oh, happy day, when the news came in
But what to do, when they found out Sue was having twins
When they could not pass each other in the hall
Well, Sue would smile and say, ""This place is really, really small""
""But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this""
That little white frame house still keeps them warm
Though it's been thirty-two years, since the kids were born
And when they look back now, they hold each other tight
And whisper in each other's ears, ""You know you were right""
""Because love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss

Reach out, distance enough, and fair maiden in hand,
All in all, we ain't... But, we press on!
I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others happiness, not by each others misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"" - Charles Chaplin

I wanted to give her five, 'cause that's how old I am""
But the lady said I couldn't buy 'em with just a dime
Well, the little fellow's story kind a touched my heart
So I told the lady to give him what he wanted and charge it to me
Then I told her I needed to wire a dozen roses to my Mama
Up in Chapel Hill, Tennessee
I looked around, and the little boy was gone
But all of a sudden the door flew open and he come runnin' back in
And he said, Mister, I forgot to thank you for the roses
He smiled, he shook my hand, and ran back out again
Well, I started on out of town, and I was feelin' real proud

When I looked out the window and I saw that same little boy
Kneelin', by a grave in an old cemetery
I stopped my car and walked over to where the little boy
Was kneelin' down, and he smiled up at me and said
""This is where my Mama stays""
She says, ""She sure does thank you for these pretty roses""
Well that's when I had to walk away
And I drove straight back to that flower shop

Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend"

The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning dew still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze

I was sitting with my glass and spoon.
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was a jug of punch.

A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was a jug of punch.
If I were sick, and very bad
And were not able to go or stand,
I would not think it at all amiss
To pledge my shoes for a jug of punch.
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie

I would not think it at all amiss
To pledge my shoes for a jug of punch.
What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire,
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And upon his table a jug of punch.
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And upon his table a jug of punch.

No costly tombstone will I have,
I'll dig a grave both wide and deep
With a jug of punch at my head and feet."

She never cared much how anyone felt

Vivid in their dream

How selective they wish to perceive
In the lie, they want to believe

In which all life is now appraised
Another valueless commodity
On which the paracious may feebly graze
Indebted homage to their mammon
Whilst the mort is the music of the meek
Transcendence from a beatifully brutal reality
Is what I seek
Noxious, sully dolour
Is not the sentiment upon which we feed
But precocious consciousness
Draws out a morbid nous to bleed
Chiselling out seething words
Which cut deep down to the bone
Always legible
So be it on our own headstone
Rising to out own nadir
Reality we try to extirpate
Trying to raise a twisted smile
Similar to that silver plate
On a coffin which is joined
Hammering in each final nail
Last kill and testament
Left now intestate
Noxious, sully dolour
Is not the thesis which is bled
A precarious train of thought
In which mental cattle-trucks are led
Carving out skilful words
Which shear brittle bones

Espoused with the bizzare

I found her settin' on a Sioux City park bench, on a late November afternoon. Me, I was just driftin' through. She said she was fourteen, and runnin' away from home. And no, she wouldn't mind some company. So I sat down and smoked my last cigarette; she pulled out a candy bar. And we started talkin' about the hows and the whys, and we watched the first snow start to fall.
I said, ""Hey, little girl. I know the rest of the world looks a lot better to you now. But you know, you gotta hold onto your home. 'Cause home is what's gonna keep you warm. So if you gotta run someplace, run on outta this here park, and back home. Now, I don't have no money to help get you there, but here: take my coat. I can't let you go cold.""

I wish there was more that I could give you
Though I know it's your own life to live
But you're so alone
And far away from home
I wish there was more that I could give
[Spoken]
Standin' out at the edge a' town, leanin' on the Route 20 sign, snow blowin' all around, I thought about my home, and how far away it was. And then as night come on and the wind picked up, I started thinkin' about the cold, and the blizzard I might be spendin' the night with. And I realized I didn't have a coat anymore. I was alone. And somewhere, so was that little girl.
Well, along about midnight I was ready to say my prayers, 'cause the road was gone and I wasn't far behind. And then I saw some lights, whirlin' and flashin', and a patrolman helped me into a warm car. And there inside was my little runaway friend; and she wrapped my coat around me. Well, all I could say was ""Thank you both, for savin' my life."" But the patrolman looked me in the eye and said, ""Thank you, for sendin' my little girl back home to me.""

Where most folks seem to stick around

I'd sit out on the dock till dawn
And dream about the great beyond

A world traveler
Set me loose to find my way
Just get me out on the road someday
With my sails unfurled
So many mysteries
I wanted to unravel
If I could travel the world
Soon enough I had my way
I saw the world the Lord has made
Mostly from the interstate
But I had hardly seen a thing
Until I gave a golden ring
To the one who gave her heart to me
(And I became)
A world traveler
That's the day I hit the road
'Cause I walked the hills of the human soul
Of a tender girl
I'm a world traveler
She opened the gate and took my hand
And led me into the mystic land
Where her galaxies swirl
So many mysteries
I never will unravel
I want to travel the world
Take a left at the end of my street
Just a few doors down
Up the hill and into the trees
There's a hole in the ground
Where we traveled the caverns so deep
We wandered the wonders so wide
It was right beneath our feet
All this time, all this time
Tonight I saw the children in their rooms
Little flowers all in bloom
Burning suns and silver moon
And somehow in that starry sky
The image of the Maker lies
Right here beneath my roof tonight
(So hold on tight, I'm a)
World traveler
Pack yours bags and dig down deep
Let's ride the storms and sail the seas
To the distant pole

Into these uncharted lands
To blaze a trail in the vast expanse
Of the heart and soul
In the grace of the God of peace

Come on, come on with me
And get up in that saddle
There's a million mysteries

Come for me
What happened to the blinking red lights
They must have run out of batteries
And I should stand up for my friends
Because I believe in them
And if someone puts them down
Why am I silent till the end
You better smile when I say hi
Because I'm smiling whenever you're nearby
Well I guess you don't make a big deal
Out of anything anymore
And you pass a car turned over on the side of the road
You contemplate a reversal of the roles
But you don't pull over to help
You'll forget about it
Three seconds down the road
Well have you figured it out
Have you figure it out
Well have you figured it out
Have you figured it out
Well have you figured it out
Have you figured it out
Cause I haven't got a clue
And I held everything against you
Because you see you never held anything at all
Against me
You better smile when I say hi
Because I'm smiling whenever you're nearby
Well I guess you don't make a big deal
Out of anything anymore
And I was crossing the tracks
I saw a big yellow light
Coming for me
What happened to the blinking red lights

Just forget about it all

Writer Tommy Dilbeck
I asked a little boy to call his daddy He said he couldn't and sighed And when I asked him what was wrong Here's what the little boy replied. My Daddy is only a picture, In a frame that hangs on the wall Each day I talk to my daddy, But he never talks at all. I tell him all of my secrets And all of my little plans And from the way he smiles at me, I know he understands. The angels took Daddy to heaven, When I was just goin' on three But I'll bet they never told him How blue and lonesome we'd be. I try to cheer up my mommie, When the tears roll down her face My daddy is only a picture, But I'm tryin' to take his place."

She wants the wine
He brings a case to carry them on through
I said you know what I now
About the bedroom boys
Udercover Russians in a pink Rolls Royce
They bang the drum, she sets the beat
They carry Miss America out into the street
She sings Snowman! Scarecrow! John Doe! Buffalo!

In the snowbound days
Riding the subway in a Valium haze
I need the white, she gets the blues
It carries us on through
All these American boys
At the park 'n' shop
Selling their memories fro a dollar a pop
Ivan the ancient spaceman race fan
Corners the market on American tastes
And says Spaceman! Scarecrow! Peepshow! Freakshow!

All the sudden light inside you dies
Maybe you're going on alone
Maybe you're going all alone
She dreams of sunlight, sings of smaller things
White sugar bowls and wedding rings
And you're going on from me alone
You're going on, you're on your own
She was married alive in a Moscow surgery
Hoping to die in a cold war nursery
All of the kids back home
Believe in much more than we do
It's a memory play, where the memory fades
Into pictures you took
Into records we played
Spy vs. Spy, Scrarecrow and I
Out across the darkness where the bomber jets fly
Singing Spaceman! Smokeshow! Scarecrow! Geronimo!

The Reverend took him swimmin' and the devil must have drowned
Uncle Chester he was big, he was mean and even vicious
But he didn't stand a chance against the lawman Reverend Brown
The lawman Reverend Brown was the Sheriff of Pitman County
His hair was long and black like the dusty suit he wore
In the pockets of his coats were the tools of his profession
A tattered old black bible and a loaded 44
And all across the mountain you could hear the children singin'
'Bout the peace down in the valley like there never was before
The Reverend had a special way for healin' wicked sinners
He only had to shoot a few to save a whole lot more
I don't know where he came from but I do know where he's gone
He's gone to meet his maker and to guard the masters thrown
And to keep a home fire burnin' for the ones lost in the night
The kind of fire he lit in me to help me see the light
And all across the mountain you could hear the children singin'
'Bout the peace down in the valley like there never was before
The Reverend had a special way for healin' wicked sinners
He only had to shoot a few to save a whole lot more
The lawman helped the Reverend when he taught the old time gospel
It was Heaven, it was prison over the loaded 44
All across the mountain you could hear the children singin'

In his mind, he is God. Sacrifices in human blood
His sickened art is holy deeds.

She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a snake.

Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella.

You'll crack 'em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors

And like a flash he darted out his little friend to meet
He never saw this speeding car nor heard this screeching sound
And before the driver knew it he had run poor Tommy down

In memory of people
Without them you would not exist
And memory of people
Who would not exist without you
What would you give to live your life again?
What would you change with a second chance?
And could you learn from the mistakes? I don't know...
Longing for the meaning of life
while breathing day in and day out
realize how slight it is
keep an eye on the universe at night
What would you give to live your life again?
What would you change with a second chance?
And could you learn from the mistakes? I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know...

My momma spent her short life, raisin' kids and bailin' hay
And I was just fifteen when I ached inside to wonder
So I hoped a freight in Waycross and I rode it to L.A.
Well, I met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Maybel Joy
Destitution's child, born on a L.A. street called Shane
And sleep came and left this little Waycross Georgia country boy
Maybel Joy was gone, Lord, I'd never see her again
Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Maybel Joy
Laughter found our morning's, brought new meaning to my life
I woke up one day, Lord to find that I was by myself
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine
Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine
Who said, ""Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green""
Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy
Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train
Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door
With a bullet in my side I cried, ""Have you seen Maybel Joy?""
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Son, she don't live here no more""
She left this town ten years ago, I heard she's looking for
Some Georgia farm boy"""

Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory
The old tire swing where my little boys play
Well, that was me only yesterday
Doing double back flips off the branch in the tank
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank
We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Passed down from my granny and my grandpa
Mom and daddy kept it safe, kept it sturdy and tall
Summers were hot, winters were long
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong
Now some are gone, and some are all grown
You and me, baby, branched out on our own
With every sunset comes another sunrise
I can see my daddy in our little boys' eyes
We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Lost love once throughout the years
Remember their smiles and dry those tears
'Cause they'll live on in your heart and mine
So let love grow like a country vine
We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree

I open my weary eyes once again
My life has been left hollow and ashes have filled the gorge of my within
Last night I hoped and wished I'd die in my sleep but no catharsis was granted to
me
Will this pain ever pass?
The enchanting perfume of winter and the bleak, cold breath of her still haunts
me...
Oportet ubique pulchritudinem evanescere
So half of me rode to the mountains and the other half soared high in the winds
to a place where the angels had fallen, the soil gagged and choked on their wings
My soul was the pale skyline that she stretched across the horizon
Two years had brought the fire that she paints upon my loathsome canvas
She is the dark one...
As a bird I watched her from my cold tower in the heavens
and when she fell from the northplace, I flew down and embraced her
I took her where the snow falls forever, she showed me the haunted woods
We gathered together in the oaken palace, free from both death and life
The fire blazed in her eyes one day and she tore the soul from my chest
With a bleeding heart, I flew back to my cold tower
to never escape and lie in a pool of death forever
I saw the nightfall...
It called to me like a river of shadows
It sang to me with the cries of a thousand ravens that blackened the sky as they
took flight
and sank the Sol
I shall never trust the sun again, Eridanis Nadir
I ran away far into the woods
To find the Sol, I called to her...
""I don't want to be forgotten...I never wanted to be human""
NEVER!!!!!
So alas the sun had descended, her fire burned brilliant in the sky
The trees bore their withered silhouettes, that cast a spell upon unearthly white
No wolf shall keep his secrets, no bird shall dance the skyline
And I am left with nothing but an oath that gleams like a sword
To bathe in the blood of man
Mankind...

- Eric Bogle
Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack, and I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback, well, I waltzed my Matilda all over.
Then in 1915, my country said son, It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done.
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun, and they marched me away to the war.
And the band played Waltzing Matilda, as the ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears, we sailed off for Gallipoli
And how well I remember that terrible day, how our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay, we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.
Johnny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well. He shower'd us with bullets,
And he rained us with shell. And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.
But the band played Waltzing Matilda, when we stopped to bury our slain.
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs, then we started all over again.
And those that were left, well we tried to survive, in that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive, though around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head, and when I woke up in my hospital bed,
And saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead. Never knew there was worse things than dyin'.
For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda, all around the green bush far and free
To hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs-no more waltzing Matilda for me.
So they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed, and they shipped us back home to Australia.
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane, those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay, I looked at the place where me legs used to be.
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me, to grieve, to mourn, and to pity.
But the band played Waltzing Matilda, as they carried us down the gangway.
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared, then they turned all their faces away
And so now every April, I sit on me porch, and I watch the parades pass before me.
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march, reviving old dreams of past glories
And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore. They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
And the young people ask, what are they marching for? And I ask myself the same question.
But the band plays Waltzing Matilda, and the old men still answer the call,
But as year follows year, more old men disappear. Someday no one will march there at all.
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

Historical Note:
The Gallipoli Campaign (April 25, 1915-January 8, 1916),
A major land and sea operation of World War I, in which
British, French, Australian, and New Zealand forces
Unsuccessfully attempted an invasion of Turkey.
The action was confined to the Dardanelles Strait
And the tip of the Gallipoli (Gelibolu) Peninsula near
Istanbul. The purpose of the campaign, devised by British
Munitions minister David Lloyd George, first lord of the
Admiralty Winston Churchill, General Herbert H. Kitchener,
And Admiral Sackville H. Carden, was to open up a new
Theater of war as an alternative to the stalemate in
France, to relieve Turkish pressure on Russian forces
In the Caucasus, and, by gaining control of Istanbul
And the straits, to provide a direct link with Russia
Via the Black Sea. This campaign is also significant
For Australians in that it marked the first time a major
Australian military force was commanded by Australian,
Instead of English, officers.
What initially was to be exclusively a naval operation
Failed in February 1915 when several British and French
Ships were damaged by floating mines. A land invasion was
Then decided on, but it was not begun until late April.
An amphibious landing at that time was met with heavy
Resistance by the Turks. Excessive caution and timorous
Leadership by the British commander, Sir Ian Hamilton,
Resulted in several lost initiatives. Little headway
Was made beyond the several beachheads. In early August,
After three months of stalemate and stagnation on the
Beaches, a new major offensive was begun. Once again,
However, the excessive caution and indifferent leadership
Of the British command offset the effect of heavy
Reinforcements. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were
Inspired by the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (Kemal AtatÃ¼rk,
Later president of Turkey) and the skill of their German
Commander, Otto Liman von Sanders. After a few more months
Of stalemate, Hamilton was replaced by Sir Charles Monro,
Who was sent to evaluate the situation. Monro recommended
Evacuation, and the allied forces were withdrawn in December
And January. British casualties were 205,000 out of 410,000;
The French sustained a rate of 47,000 out of 79,000; Turkish,
250,000 to 300,000 out of 500,000. The fiasco badly
Stained the reputations of Churchill, Hamilton, and Kitchener.
Despite its overall failure, however, the Gallipoli campaign
Weakened the Turks enough to facilitate the British seizure
Of Palestine in 1917. The action also distracted the Germans
From a plan they had in 1915 to begin another offensive in France."

An unimaginable force of their mindless soldiers
Their primary objective has now been put in place
A movement to eliminate every creative thinking mind
As every nation is beaten down and famed
Our world will be given up to a dominating regime
A new, absolute power of unmerciful rule
They suppress every quality that makes us human
They will consume and scorch the entire globe
Through subliminal programming brainwashing and mind control
A bastard race to rule with blood soaked iron fists
With totalitarianism they squash their opposition
A regime based on domination and enthropicide
We must not yield to the superpowers that mold us
They want us passive, with no individuality
Conscienceless clone troops mow down and try us
We are nothing more than livestock to model a new race
To be neutered and conformed
Reproducing pseudo-beings that look exactly like we do
The clones are replicas of you and I
Our very features and physicalities mocked up for reproduction
The human race replaced
There may be a solution, it's our one glimmer of hope
True patriots must find the strength within themselves to fight
We must cut the cloning at it's bloody roots
This is our only chance if we are to stay human
We must not allow the cybernauts to take our place
By killing the commander in chief and his cabinet
Final result weed out the weak
World domination modern tyrants seek
Old decrees snuffed out and lost
Cloning begins, global holocaust"

Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night
Not seein' 'em with you baby

The dissonant bells of the sea who are ringing the rhymes of the deep
As they sing of the ages asleep, not so near or so far
And the old masters wind of the waves sped forth for the free men and slaves
Whispers of secrets it saves and about whom they are.
And the workings of sunshine and rain
And the visions they paint that remain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain in a spanish guitar.
The beggar whom sits in the street on his miserable throne of defeat
Envisions no wealth there to meet, thinking nowhere is far
And the laughter of children employed by the fantasies not yet destroyed
By the dogmas of those they avoid knowing not what they are.
And the right and the wrong and insane
And the answers they cannot explain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain in a spanish guitar.
To play on a spanish guitar with the sun shining down where you are
Skipping and singing a bar from the music around
Just to laugh through the columns of trees, to soar like a seagull in breeze
To stand in the rain if you please or to never be found."

A tale of an instrument of death
Watch us as we pass the axe.
I took the axe off the shelf in the tool shed
It's telling me I gotta fuckin' bloody the misled
My victim approached
Cut her head off at the throat
She was a hooker with AIDS
Spreading disease like it was dope
Cut the head off her pimp
Before he started to trash talk
Two bodies in my trunk and police on a manhunt
I'm on the noose again
They chasing me for blocks
Seen a homie on the street
So I passed the axe to Madrox
I took the axe
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?
It's all bloody
And it looks like its been in and out of someone's back
Gristle on the handle, blood dripping down the neck
So I grabbed that bitch like back
Who want to get half fed up by the half with
Who got a gang of problems
And don't give half a shit, bitch
You can fall victim to the double headed fury
Don't be scared, be worried, man.
Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back (I'll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back.(I'll hack you)
I took the axe back to the shed where I stay
Cleaned off the blood and then sharpened up the blade
Waited 'til dark and then ran through the hood
And chopped up drunk bums like they're blocks of wood
I can't see myself stopping, if I do then I'm dead
And the only way I'm dying is if I sever my own head
Grip on the tip, so my nub won't slip
And I'm about to fuckin' pass it to the hands of 2 Dope bitch
I took the axe and swung it through like butter
When I cut ya back you better run, duck, and cover.
You know your jugular well, it's gone
I blacked out last night, realized in the morning
Gotta dig another hole in the backyard
Run get me a shovel, it ain't that hard
Understand I got a hairpin trigger wrist
When I squeeze it off, haha, you get the gist.
Pass me something sharp and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
I took the axe
Perhaps I had a relapse
I seen a pretty pretty neck
And I couldn't relax
I cut through it
I throw knives with precision
But it's nothing like the feeling
Of committing the incision
Flip it over, a radio programmer
Pound his head into a bloody pizza
With a hammer
Threw it into the sky and let it stick in my back
And passed out at Monoxide's front porch like that.
I took the axe and lost my fucking mind
On this cop who pulled up behind me
I handcuffed him on the side of the street
And started smacking em with it like I was making a beat
Oh God!
Another cop pulled up
So I grabbed the same axe and planted it in his forehead
Two more dead, bloody and dismembered
Now it's back in the shed and that's all I remember.
Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (I'll throw it right back to you)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)

Its back to the tool shed to relax

Not one ribbon for her hair.
through the night my heart was aching,
Just before the dawn was breaking.
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.
If i live to be a hundred,
I will never know from where.
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair."

My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say how appropriate
I don't want to dissect everything today

There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter
And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance

I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy
And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the Maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I am humbled by his humble nature
What I wouldn't give to find a soul mate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses
Falling all around, all around
Why are you so petrified of silence
Here can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die
Or did you long for the next distraction
And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer"

And the anchors have been weighed
From Miami to Nassau
She's bound across the waves
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay
Into the open sea
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it
Now the many years she's been to sea
She's seen the better times
She gives a groan of protest
As they cast away her lines
And the grumble of her engines
And the rust along her spine
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'
But the sands run out within her heart
A tiny spark glows red
It smolders through the evening
There's laughter overhead
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt
And the drinks are passed around
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'
Now it's midnight on the open sea
And the moon is shinin' bright
Some people join the party
And others say goodnight
There's many who are sleepin' now
It's been a busy day
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning
Let someone understand""
But her silent plea is wasted
In the playin' of the band
Everybody's dancin' on her deck
And they're havin' such a time
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle
The fire begins to glow
It leaps into the hallways
And climbs and twists and grows
And the paint she wore to keep her young
Oh Lord, how well it burns
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast
The captain stands aloft
He calls up to the boatswain, says
""Boatswain, we are lost""
For the ragged hoses in the racks
No pressure do they hold
And the people down below will soon be dyin'
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now
It's spreadin' fore and aft
The people are a-scramblin'
As the fire blocks their path
The evil smoke surrounds them
And they're fallin' in their tracks
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star
Comes steamin' through the night
She sees the Castle blazin'
And 'tis a terrible sight
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries
""We'll save you if we can""
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'
""God help the ones who sleep below
And cannot find the way
Thank God for those we rescue
Upon this awful day""
Now the heroes, they are many
But the times are growin' slim
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'
She's cryin' like a child
You can hear her if you listen
Above the roar so wild
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie
Within her molten sides?
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'
But the livin' soon were rescued
The ones who lived to tell
From the Star they watched her
As she died there in the swells
Like a toy ship on a mill pond
She burned all through the night
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'"

And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack
Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test
He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire
He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled

Writers Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer
Yesterday when I was young the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. I teased at life as if it were a foolish game, the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned I always built alas on weak and shifting sand. I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day and only now I see how the years ran away. Yesterday when I was young so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see. I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out, I never stopped to think what life was all about and every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all. Yesterday the moon was blue and every crazy day brought something new to do. I used my magic age as if it were a wand and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond. The game of love I played with arrogance and pride and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died. The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away and only I am left on stage to end the play. There are so many songs in me that won't be sung; I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue. The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young."

wolf
drinking my blood. My body lay on the snow, disabled, mortally wounded.
I, the last of the mountain's clan. Pursued and wounded by enemies,
Passed away in this place.
I'm still hearing the horn sounding far away, Herds of ravens are
following
there. But I can't get there anymore...I am so far from my burnt home.
I see the snow falling on my face,
But I am not able to throw it down.
I see my eyes closed
And mouths congealed in pain,
They will never say anything anymore...
Winds bring the black clouds...
Soon the thick snow will fall.
Wind! Hide my dead body!
I hear my persecutors are coming...
I will regenerate In the shape of wolf with black bristle
I will draw my fangs In the river of enemies' blood!

Drive a bitch batty, got her brain going wild
She don't love me she love my doggy style, screaming
Daddy, come fuck me, come fuck me
You're like a vacuum girl, the way you suck me
Pull your hair, spank that ass quick roughly
I know the flavor of love and you bucky
Girl, trust me, I make you feel incredible
Pussy is edible
I make it wet no man could do it better boo
Your head good you got a future ahead of you, la
I been waiting, tonight, girl, it's on

You ain't been with me yet, you ain't really screamed yet
I'm a get you hot, tillIi make your weave sweat

Wanna see if you can get freaky until the sunrise
That pussy hot girl and it's so tight
I been waiting for you to give me the green light
See baby, we gettin' popping all in the moonlight
Wanna see if you can get freaky until the sunrise?"

Evening breeze as my only friend
It was a beautiful dusk of November
Darkness wrapping around the hills where paths end
To my eyes reflected a distant fire
A fire from far away
A sign our enemy is approaching
From the land beyond the bay
Beyond the mist covered forest on the river I saw
Three dozen ships with crosses on sails
Soon everywhere burnt fires
Mine among the others
From the village a horde was marching
Till death or fame!
To my eyes reflected a distant fire
A fire from far away
A sign our enemy is approaching
From the land beyond the bay
By the time the sun was about to rise above the skyline
The army of the cross and heathen hordes collided
By the time the sun was lurking high behind a cloud
Only the heathen swords were held against the sky
They were slaughtered and vanished for now
But they will return to spread their word and kill

Staring with a poker face, like he'd run out of luck

Cause any fool would've turned and run
Any fool would've walked away
Any fool would've given up
But an ordinary man, he chose to stay
Now Edna, she couldn't say too much, she'd seen that look before
She kept tapping on Clyde's window, till he opened up the door
Then she put her arms around him, she never said a word
And Clyde turned on the radio and neither of them heard
He said Edna why don't you hop in, I think I'll call in sick
There's three one ways to a dead end street, now you just take your pick
And she pointed to the ballfield and the park where they first kissed
And Clyde grinned like he found something that he had almost missed
CHORUS
They spent that day in freedom, they hung on for many more
Raised up quite a family, they found what love was for
And the aging never slowed them down, they leaned on faith, not luck
Still out taking Sunday drives in Clyde's old beat up truck
You know Edna, she ain't no movie star and Clyde's a little slow
The shopping mall's replaced the park where they both used to go
But that's why they've both got each other, so they can keep their dreams alive
The simple dreams, the common man, still stand the test of time

Cause home is where the hurt is
Still tryin to find myself
Stuck here in the middle of lonesome
Wishin I was somewhere else
And this achin heart wasn't filled with bitterness
So alone
Cause home is where the hurt is
Silence he ain't a stranger now
I've come to know him well somehow
Too often dreams echo with the shadows
All I know is I need a friend
Waitin on the bitter end
Bein angry ain't no way to be
Can you believe what's become of me
And all I want is to feel your skin again
Chorus
Home, Home
Home is where the hurt is
I'm so alone
Home is where the hurt is
The heart is gone
Home is where the hurt is"

Hiding out from police like I'm 'posed to
Restraining order out on me like she 'posed to
I used the ethanol to knock 'em out like I'm 'posed to
I drag the body up into the house like I'm posed to
Cut the body up into pieces just to store it
And bury 'em all under the porch like I'm 'posed to
I drank a little lawnmower gas like I'm 'posed to
Beat her head until it smashed like I'm 'posed to
Stole the cop car and crashed like I'm 'posed to

Cooked his eyes in the frying pan like I'm 'posed to

Then removed every one of his teeth like I'm 'posed to

Make sure her clothes are taken off like I'm 'posed to
Probably never should have dug her up but I was 'posed to
Spent all night by her side to be close to her
Caught her all alone in her home like I'm 'posed to
Tied her up with cords from a phone like I'm 'posed to
Now I got this freak on a leash, I'm about to toast her
All because these whispers in my ear say I'm 'posed to

Now I see her face on a missing person poster
I talk to past spirits of the dead like I'm 'posed to
Only I can pick up what they said like I'm 'posed to
They say to make them bleed and indeed I feel the need
To take them out this hunger I feed like I'm 'posed to
Keep it under my pillow like I'm 'posed to
The severed tongue of a widow named Rosa
She saw me chilling on a most wanted poster
I turned her body on the fire pit roaster
I cut the left finger off the right hand like I'm 'posed to
Carve my symbol off in they back like I'm 'posed to
Disappear off in the night like I'm 'posed to
Peep behind a murderous sight like I'm 'posed to

About curing the vapors the scratch and the gout
With their medical potions, their serums and their lotions
Upholding their notions, they're mighty put out.
Who can tell the true physic to all that's pathetic
And pitch to the divil, cramp, colic and spleen
You'll know it I think if you take a big drink
With your mouth to the brink of a jug of poteen
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh what botheration, no dose in the nation
Can give consolation like poteen me boys.
No liquid cosmetic to lovers athletic
Or bodies pathetic can give such a bloom
As the sweet by the powers in the garden of flowers
Ever gave their own bowers such a darling perfume
And this liquid so rare if you willingly share
To be taking your hair when it's frizzled and dead
Oh the sod has the merit to yield the true spirit
So strong it will shake all the hairs from your head
Then stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh since its perfection, no doctor's direction
Can cleanse the complexion like poteen me boys
While a child in me cradle, me nurse with her ladle
Was filling my mouth with a notion of pap
When a drop from her bottle fell into my throttle
I stumbled and capered clean out of her lap
On the floor I lay crawlin' and screaming and bawling
'Til me mother and father were called to the fore
All sobbing and sighing they feared I was dying
But soon found I only was crying for more.
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord how they'd chuckle if babes in their truckle
They only could suckle on poteen me boys
Through my youthful aggression, through times of depression
My childhood's impression still clung to my mind
And at school or at college the basis of knowledge
I never could gulp 'til with whiskey combined
And as older I'm growing times ever bestowin'
On Erin's potation, a flavor so fine
And how ere they may lecture on jove and his nectar
Itself is the only true liquid divine
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord, 'tis the right thing for courting and fighting
There's nowt so exciting as poteen me boys.
Come guess me this riddle, what beats pipes and fiddle
What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
What's sweeter than honey and stronger than steam
What'll make the lame walk, what will make the dumb talk,
The elixir of life and philospher's stone
And what helped Mr. Brunnell to build the Thames Tunnel
Wasn't it poteen from ould Inisowen
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord, it's no wonder, if lightning and thunder
Weren't made from the plunder of poteen me boys.
You maidens pathetic, with lovers athletic
For liquid cosmetic, you can't beat the drop
With a glow to your cheek, it will make your heart leap
It'll quiet a stallion or cure an old cob
At the mouth you would drool, be reduced to a fool
You'd kick up your heels and you'd peel to the buff
Then 'tis he'd be pathetic while you'd be athletic
If only you'd take a few drops of the stuff
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
For there's nothing like whiskey to make maidens frisky
It soon separates all the men from the boys."

Over our flowered heads
And takes us to the muddy house

Which now and forever I am going to leave
Farewell to the shores, where the shamrock is growing
It's the bright spot of beauty and the home of the brave
I'll think on its valleys with fond admiration
Though never again its bright hills will I see
I'm bound for to cross the wide swelling ocean
In search of fame and fortune and of sweet liberty
Our ship at the present lies in Derry harbour
To bear us away across the wide swelling sea
May heaven be her companion and grant her fair breezes
Till we reach the green fields of America
It's hard to be forced from the land that we live in
Our houses and farms all obiged for to sell
To wander along among Indians and strangers
To find some sweet spot where our children might dwell
Our artists, our farmers, our tradesmen are leaving
To seek for employment far over the sea
Where they'll get their riches with care and with industry
There's nothing but hardship at home if you stay
So cheer up your spirits, you lads and you lasses
There's gold for the digging and lots of it, too
A health to the heart that has courage to ramble
Bad luck to the lad or the lass that would rue
We'll call for a bumper of ale, wine and brandy
We'll drink to the health of those far away
Our hearts will all warm at the thought of old Ireland
When we're on the green fields of Americay"

his abuse of people touches the very core

Hatred, like an infection, spreads from one victim to another.

Suffocating in his own remorse, he fears the unexpected.
His nervousness takes a form of it's own.
It manifests and takes control.
To him it's real.
He's unaware that his mind has shut out his surroundings.
Isolated and alone, he starts to fear, fear itself.

It's a beautiful ring
A symbol of love surrendering
But I don't believe in
To have and to hold
It's not worth it's weight in gold
Here in my music box
Are old souvenirs
Love that was promised through the years
The hinges are broken
The music is gone
The memory still lives on
What I did for love
He gave me a promise ring
I cried - then I gave him my life
He left - and I learned to live by myself
I tried - but it wasn't enough
What I did for love
Small Cinderella doesn't turn anymore
Her face isn't like it was before
The rosette of gold was in the shape
of a heart
But years let it fall apart
What I did for love
He gave an engagement ring
I cried - then I gave him my life
He left - and I learned to live by myself
I tried - but it wasn't enough
What I did for love
Charms on my bracelet count the years we'd grow old
It's funny I thought it was gold
But one thing still shinging is my old weddings band
The mark is still on my hand
What I did for love
He gave me a wedding ring
I cried - then I gave him my life
He left - and I learned to live by myself
I tried - but it wasn't enough
What I did for love
So thank you for asking it's a beautiful ring
A symbol of love surrendering
Valued for rarity - not for it's weight
I guess you just came too late"

She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time

Until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory

And you know I hang like a hex on a barn
Grind the guardrail like a nail on a file
Above and beyond the hole nine yards
Well, I rolled Jesse Helms like a cigarette
And smoked him higher than the highest of the minarets
Jesse James couldn't even handle it
Started looking at me like I was Sanskrit
'Cause in the great shining path of the great monster trucks
There's no such thing as beginner's luck
I'm the Dirty Dozen for the price of one
Get it while it's hot, going, going, going, gone
It's about time you started learning
Started learning to come to where the flavor is, flavor is
It's about time you started learning
You started learning to come to where the flavor is, flavor is
The skies are always sunny in the heart of Flavor Country
Where the washer's stuffed with money are growing like grass
Junk bondage racks never cut you slack
But that's the way the racket goes when rounding up green backs
Don't hate me just because I'm beautiful
You'll find that it's really not unusual
When you're raised with The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
A holy trinity in Flavor Country
It's about time you started learning
Started learning to come to where the flavor is, flavor is
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
And you are my happy trail
You are my happy trail
You are my happy trail
You are my happy trail
The skies are always sunny in the heart of Flavor Country
The skies are always sunny in the heart of Flavor Country

Was a suitcase and the open road

So, I'll fill my glass up to the brim
And through my glass, my world looks dim
I know outside there's love somewhere
Maybe, my rambling will take me there

Raised on the banks of Defeated Creek
Every boy around was in love
With the black-eyed critter with the little bare feet

She hot-wired a truck at the age of 11
Beautiful child, blessed by nature
Breaking hearts left and right when she was a teenager

And you must pay before you get them back again.

And you shouldn't be afraid for
Every time it rains it rains
Pennies from heaven.
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven.

All over town.
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down.

With nothing to hold on to
I've been attacked by storms of disillusions
Vessel of isms that was my security
Has now become a wreck
Waves of indifferance
Forcefully they crush my hope
I see no point in struggling for survival
But in the distance
There is a light so bright
A glimpse of hope in sight
Lighthouse, shines
Salvation is at hand
It is the Saviour my light His name is Jesus Christ
It is the Saviour it is the light
It is the Son of God"

That came in through the pretty window picture.
I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""
Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""
I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You."

Recognizing pre-war signs and dialects
But Lord Elmreckt was a master intellectual
Capable of feats unproven by science
The first step: to understand the fear
To control the reflexes of mental lapse
Following this: the medicinary state
Where expanding the mind is possible by the use of linear projection
And for long months, I listened, practiced and learned
My mind's eye has transcended the scars of the earth
My awareness immense, my instincts now honed
Lord Elmreckt and I were tapping into the unknown
And oh, the sight and the sound!
Like a billion explosions, but black and calm
And this alleged continuum of space and time?
It is not at all like what is said in thr old world's books
""Quiet"" he said, ""We are travelling at a humungous speed
Down an unchartable quarter of the astral sleet""
It was so intense that I felt death grip me
Toy with me, follow me and then let me go

Tried to cultivate there. It is important that their work is completed.

Breaking rocks for ten or twenty years

Standing by me 'cause you love me

And you demand instant gratification.
Your needs are our main concern.
Let's be honest,
As consumers we all have needs and desires.
Trouble is, we suppress them
In nature, as in the business world,
Now there are winners and there are losers.
But does the predator pity the prey?
I don't think so.
It's not just unnatural, it's plain unhealthy.
Nurture your desires.
Cultivate your desires.
Let them grow and flower into the blossom that is greed.
You see, you are needed.
Your greed provides this country
With the fertile financial soil in which the roots of exploitation
Can spread, live, grow and flourish.
This in turn furnishes you,
The consumer, the standard of living you've come to expect.
The products you buy, the programs you watch, the car you drive, your job.
These are the things that define you as an individual.
Without them you have no identity, no purpose, no reason to exist.
Greed.
Hatred.
They're not just good ideas,
They're the precepts this country was founded on.
They will keep you right where you are.

You drove me crazy, now there's no maybe
So grab your guns, and pick your side
'Cause this means war!
I'm going to turn around and walk right out that door,
And in your mind you've never seen my face before
Somehow they've made you believe, believe in the lie
Don't let them take me away, don't let them take me
Don't let them take me away, oh God don't let them take me
Don't try to say you've forgotten about me

our life into a mess, what you know
about poverty you learned in a book.
Think you're really qualified to
mouth off and theorize about the fears
you've never even felt.
Time's past to button up,
taste the fare on which they sup and tighten your own belt.
Get in line with us a while, see ya humbly watch
your child's health held in balance by the whim of the system.
Between Cosette and the privileged few
A fat dog chokes down more than he can chew
A poor land's labours are a rich land's gain
Little Oliver lives again
The red scare has come and gone,
a temporarily peaceful dawn finds us lost without a villain.
When the free market reigns supreme will Lazarus cheer
and scream or will the new bosses' wage be the same?
What's it mean to buy and own when all is God's and God's alone,
does a father feed half his children?
Our glory is indeed our shame if our comfort breeds on others' pain.
This feast would be better if it wasn't so lonely.
Theologies of liberation formed by mother's desperation,
the church condemns but offers little else.
Brother sun and sister moon hear a starving
child's tune thanking God for all His goodness.
Across the seas the bitter mutter behind ivy walls and drawn
shutters they plot to keep their own.
Moths and worms around us gather,
a slow wrath descends a ladder.
Mercy received in the measure it was given."

Though the miles are between us
I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin'
And the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
It seems I have no friend
I feel the blues movin' in
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad
And broken-hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
Between the lines are mixed emotions
And there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today
I'll cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
My state of mind is desperate
And this hole that I'm sinkin' in
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm askin'
Tell me you still love me
That would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in"

The fools are kings, tearing apart the soul
The race for complication, communicate reaction
The lack of heart of men, I grow distant from the core
Borrow this body for a lifetime, earthly material
My soul unraveled out of mental
The shell returns to dust
I focus on the present, concentrate on what I find
Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
Bring light to my attention, the walls of vacuum fall
This force increases and tells me where to go
Follow, I enter my dimension, awakened heart for life
Enforce my senses understanding
I find the will to live straight
I feel the change, I see the vicious circle
Finally turned into a virtuous one
Having the whole world in my hands filled
Timelessness
Out of the frame I feel so vast I'm all around myself
Imaginative interaction
But I keep struggling inside to hold this always
Forever there
Is it the fear to fall in space that keeps us from understanding?
The only way to find the power is to look inside
Increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow
Now you hold this secret, appeared out of the vacuum of space
Remain in what you are, the center of your life
You made it to this point, no one can tell you how
You crawled and bled all the way but you were the only one
That was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself"

Dipped in the batter, country fried
Washed in the blood, wrapped in camouflage
A staunch defender of the right side.
I grew up accustomed to the rebel flag,
Under the shadow of the cross,
Down where the colors never mixed too well,
Some folks still mad cuz the south lost.
But Im a good-hearted, free-thinking son-of-a-gun,
I may talk a little trash, but I dont hate anyone.
[Chorus:]
I love black people, I love brown people,
I love muslims and jews, hindus and atheists too,
Yes, I love everyone.
I love gay people, No Im not afraid people,
I may sing with a drawl, keep a little slack in my jaw, but I love everyone.
My roots are buried in the Georgia clay,
They keep me well-grounded and strong
That little town off of the interstate
Is the only place Ill ever call home.
But Ive been above the Mason-Dixon line,
Flew across the ocean too
Ive seen Gods children everywhere Ive been
They love to laugh as much as we do.
So Im careful of the pride that goes before the fall.
Im one for mending a fence instead of buildin walls.
I love black people, I love brown people,
I love muslims and jews, hindus and atheists too,
Yes, I love everyone.
No Im not gay people, but Im not afraid people,
I may sing with a drawl, keep a little chew in my jaw, but I love everyone.
It aint the corn bread or the collard greens
Sweet tea or bar-b-que
The country music on your radio, or the gospel in the pew
It aint your boots, it aint your old blue jeans,
The tractors that we drive,
It aint the rifles, or the fishing poles, or the slower pace of life,
Its how we treat our neighbors treat our neighbors that makes us who we are.
I love black people. I love brown people.
I may sing with a drawl, keep a little slack in my jaw, but I love everyone.
I may sing with a drawl, keep a little chew in my jaw, but I love everyone."

Rose of England, sweet and fair, shining with the sun,

Through the summer days and nights, stolen kisses and delights

To the abbey she did ride, with her lover by her side,
When they heard the church bells ring, she was Queen
And one day, he'd be King;
But men of malice, men of hate, protesting to her chambers came,
""A foreign prince will have your hand, for he'll bring peace
And riches to our land"";
She said ""Do you tell me that I cannot wed the one I love?
Do you tell me that I am not mistress of my heart?""
And so with heavy weight of life she kissed her lover one last time,
""This land I wed, and no man comes, for if I cannot have you, I'll have none"";

On the ones who dare not tell
See the drunkard in the tavern
Stemming gold to make ends meet
See the youth in ghetto black
Condemned to life upon the street

He takes a tarnished cross into his hand

He gallops off across the dusty plain

Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

He was 30 years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave

What makes you the happiest
Your family's blood, I understand
For faith in God you keep on living
And for your children one day you'll die
Abandon children look for Satan
The demons will molest them
Without faith in God you keep on living
And for your children, some day I'll return
Many children raise themselves
They were scared, where were you
When they grow up they won't love you
Because of your children one day you'll die
With time the children will rule
They're spoiled rotten and they hate you
I load the virus using sound
And for your children some day I'll return
Take care of the children; take care of the children
Two thousand years without another change
Fathered priests without families
Many have them but well hidden
Everyone know the about this lie
Two thousand years without one change
What makes you the happiest
When your living that lie
Because faith in God keeps you dying
And for your children here I come!
Take care of the children; take care of the children
Two thousand years without another change"

Lester Cousins left his brothers on a work truck filled with others
'Cause his father left his mother years ago
And Lester's mother took in lovers to feed and clothe his younger brothers
So at thirteen years our Lester chose to go
Men introduced him to hard labour, moving earth and stacking hay
Were all the options that were open to the boy
And the same men showed our Lester Lady Lucks appeal and blessed her
With a trusting young disciple to enjoy
With the gamblin' came the drinkin' and the cocaine and the sinkin'
That accompanies a man who's falling down
And pretty soon the fightin' and the whoring every night
And pills and losing left his spirit on the ground
Well there comes a time when even hardened men need to believe in
Something more and look within and be afraid
When a particularly rough night took his friend in one more gun fight
For the first time in his hard life Lester prayed
Lester now, Lester now, keep it together, we all want to see you succeed
Lester now, Lester now, hold it together, cuz your goodness is what the world needs
Lester now, Lester now, keep it together and dont lose that spirit of yours
And for the sake of us all, Lester, try not to fall with the weight of the world at your door
Well God led Lester to a lady who was finally worth the wait
He bought a ring and changed his ways and settled down
And he farmed his forty acres, raised a daughter, loved his Maker
Loved his wife and earned respect all through the town
Hard at work and clean and sober fifteen years come this October
All the vices of his past had disappeared
Very little did he know then that the young, out of control men
That his motherd learned to dread would reappear
Well his life and home were shattered and his wife and daughter battered
When the kind he knew so well came back around
An incontainable aggression induced Lester to regress and
Coldly murder those whod raped the love hed found
It didnt take them long to find him or convict him or confine him
To a cell block full of wounded prisoner doom
Because despite his mothers will, her Lester Cousins was a killer now
Whod never live to leave the jailers tomb
Lester now, Lester now, keep it together, we all want to see you succeed
Lester now, Lester now, hold it together, cuz your goodness is what the world needs
Lester now, Lester now, keep it together and dont lose that spirit of yours
And for the sake of us all, Lester, try not to fall with the fate of the world on the floor
And for the sake of us all, Lester, try not to fall with the hate of the world as your whore"

Some words of wisdom from a great old hymn
They call me Whispering Bill
Well today what I want to whisper is hope
Whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
I got another letter from a single mom
Telling me she and her two children are just barely getting by
The child support payments come late and sometimes they don't come at all
The cost of sending the kids to school is growing every day
She is working two jobs just to make ends meet
She says sometimes there is just no light at the end of the tunnel, only darkness
And sometimes she feels like ending it all
I just hope she will remember these words
Wait 'till the darkness is over wait 'till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone
No matter how dark and how turbulent things may seem
The darkness will turn to light and the storm will calm
I hope these folks are listening as I whisper these words of hope
Not just for them but for any one
Who finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation
It may be the homeless, the sick, the broken family
The business man even the leaders of our country
Anybody can be overcome by sorrow and desperation
And while I am just one man with one voice
I can lift it up in a hopeful message
That wherever there is life there is hope
Whispering hope oh, how welcome Thy voice
Bathing my heart in it's sorrow rejoice Whispering Hope"

It was invoked in my dreams.
Moreover, I desired it. My life-elixir;
it has been taken from me, to the very last pearl.
My iris, covered with a grey-shade;
darkens the light in my eyes.
A little sprinkle of light holds on to what we call life.
...Appearing to be the almost eradicated glow of firewood;
the source of ALL.
The fire that once shined so bright.
The light finally dead, welcoming an uprising smoke, heralding my
departure.
From here;
I'll start my travel.
Now, where is my Shangri-la, as you promised me?
Are you the angel saying that this is not my destiny?
Saying I should travel home, my body is waiting for me?
Continuing that path, be attended with disheartenment!
Endowed with a second life;
this angel granted me only misery.
I had to find my body again, embraced by dirt within the earth.
I awoke the fire inside to walk this God-forsaken earth again.
Invoking razor-blade dreams.
I'm bathing in blood, coloured....red.
Why me, why Tantalus is my destiny?
Being like Hydra, all of it is useless.
Redeemed from a thousand deaths;
I'm anchored to pain.
YOU my angel, are going to endure the Dianthus crown."

To guide them back home

The footprints of angels
Brought to fellowship there
By your mercy lamp's flame

The weary soul life's forgotten
Bringing comfort and love

Plains of otherness
The utter emptiness
Where time have ceased and dark and light collide
Crossing the river of death and water cold
Slowly walking up the bridge
The jeweled bridge I walk for what seems a lifetime
In the night it's jewels glow
There on the other side
On shore of no return
The one for me awaits
Cannot avoid the eyes
In which the fire burns
Comed this far it is too late
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to Enter the Eternal Fire
I walk this endless night
His eyes the only light
Repeatedly he whispers my name
Fingers move and twist
Through crimson thick dark mist and voices cry of agony and pain
Close now to his kingdom
The bleak world dark and still
I follow the voice whispering my name
Approach the gate of sin
Opened up to let me in and there, He stand in flames
The price now I must pay for eternity my soul his claim
For years of pleasures, victory and gold
The one who stand in flames
Now rise and walk my way and reach out for my soul
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to fall down. The Eternal Fire"

I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words had truthful vengeance
That could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Gave your heart to every bedsit room, at least a
Picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
Your paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared
Together than alone
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend

In your eyes and sang your sad songs
We buckled down and broke the bottles spilling dreams across the street
Erase the images the pitter pat of tiny feet.
Sing the song of sorrow

Starting now there will be a brand new day"

Out where the whoopin' cranes fly
I'll show you the white bones
Of giants in sandstone
Out where the wind never dies
Come sit by the campfire
I'll sing you a sad song
Of rivers that never return
Play soft on the mouth-harp
Strum slow on the guitar
And leave all the mem'ries to burn

That flows through the sandhills at dawn

Where clear water races
Before all the traces are gone

And then I gave up drink cos you asked me too

Then you said we had to save for a mortgage soon

But I don't turn my head for things that pass me by
And I'm gonna have a look around
I could gather all the diamonds in the sky
Hold every one and never leave the ground, If I had a mind to
Fly through the eye of a hurricane, freeze my body like David Blaine
Be the first to find life on Mars, go up and sell a few candy bars
Climb a rainbow and kiss the sun, walk on the moon when the day is done

With an audience

To love the one you came with?

Not swift with it to vanish, but ever here remain!

When you loom back, beloved, upon the faded years
Let in the depths of shadow my memory be gone

A chant of lamentation within cold walls of chime
To beg for me in weeping the peace of endless time
As though those hours of wonder in fact we did not live
That I so deeply love you dear one can you forgive?
My face turned to the desert you left me all alone
And cold beneath my eyelids my eyes have turned to stone
And when at last death's soil my body does reclaim
Then who will know me or know from whence I came?

Afar of in distance a flock of crows arise
And darken all the heavens before my sightless eyes
Beyond the earth's steep margin a hurricane does start
Flinging to the world my dust and to the wind my heart
Yet as in spring the blossom do you remain the while
With gentle eyes and humid and tender, childish smile
So much a child, yet seeming each day to younger grow
And of my fate know nothing as I too nothing know

And cold beneath my eyelids my eyes have turned to stone

All to close their eyes

That is how they think you are
Never on the land

Never on the land
But sailing by the north star
To the tower and to the ravens and
The tale that hopes they'll never leave
What if they should go?

I wonder if they flew one day
And no one ever knew they'd gone
To circle over ships at sea
Claiming yet another son

And give them gold and they'll save your soul

and you got the right to cry,
but if you're gonna keep it up
the sunshine's gonna pass you by.
Hey, rainy Jane,

Come on rainy Jane,

On the coldest day
Abandoned by my mother
By my father I was raised
My father raised my brother and I
With a stubborn heart
My mother left me her good looks and confident charm
Well I spent most of my teenage years
Searching for her love
I could not find it anywhere
So I turned to drugs
And after all the smoke had cleared
And it was said and done
I found myself addicted by the age of twenty one
I tell the truth
I've been beaten
I've been bruised
I was left for dead as well
I was wrongfully accused
You left me locked inside a cell
I've been cheated
I've been sued
But I have lived to tell
The more you kick me when I'm down
The more it truly helps
I feel the madness creeping slowly
Loved by many, I'm still lonely
Paid the price for your mistake
The music died the day I walked away
No, I won't let you win

No, you won't take my pride
I'll keep my head held high

I know you're jealous
And you wish you could be me
I'm so smart and clever with my lyrics can't you see?
There's nobody better in this music industry
And in case you think you are, go ahead, give me a ring
Woah
I deserve a purple heart
From all my fucking wounds
Lacerations to my ego
Pride that I consume
And in your final hours
When you are looking back
You'll find that I'm the best at what I do
And that's a fact
No, I won't let you win

Being pulled by surgeon's hands.

Stricken the clinic walls.

You try to laugh it off saying ""I knew all the time...
But it`s starting to come to me"" (come to me, come to me)

Now you could tell he wanted you `cause you almost taste it on his breath
But you always cheated life just like the bold dare-devil cheated death
Incidentally, late last night your understudy finally got what you deserve
In private she`s seductive but in public she`s prim, porcelain and nervous
Afraid someone will recognize the shame in her eyes
You've still got your dignity or the next best disguise

When I come home,
We'll make up for the nights alone
When we end up making love
We're the lucky ones
They say that absence makes,
A heart grow fonder, and I know,
It's always worth the wait
But it's lonely on the road

We've been through feast and famine, yeah
We have lived on love
And we'd do it again

I took your trust and I tore it into
No man in his right mind would have said it's over
Still I told you goodbye completely sober
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
My mama knows her baby boy knows better
It's gonna break her heart to hear we're not together
She's always said she cares so much for you
So what is she gonna say about the hell I've put you through
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
Even Tennessee whiskey couldn't wash away the pain
Watered down with teardrops over light Kentucky rain
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse

To buy some Pittsburg steel when you come of age and
Even more to get it running and shinning like you did
It was two tone tar heel blue and white
Couple kinwood speakers tuned just right
Crazy how a car makes a king out of a kid
It was sun down ready, hardtop heavy,
Shotgun girlfriend primed.
Just some teenage no fear,
Half bald good years that still turned on a dime
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride in that bronco
Momma still puts flowers out by your grave
Daddy pulls against Ford in Sunday's race
And Leah has a hard time thinking she's older than you
And me I still see you backing out in reverse
The headlights bright behind your hurst
If I only could fix things like someone I once knew
I wouldn't be sitting tangled mangled full of county junk yard pain
All busted rusted out here cussing crying out your name
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride in that bronco
It was a hell of a ride

It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride
It was small town high hopes
Why it ended there only heaven knows

It was a hell of a ride
Takes a lifetime of prayers on bend and knee
To try to come to peace with your memory"

And the call of easy comfort's in the wind
But I won't slow down, I ain't got no reason to
'Cause it's just another town that she's not in

When I'm feeling like I do
So doggone empty worn-out blue
She's where I want to be and that's just making me

As the tires thump another mile away

Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy

Don't know Celsius from Fahrenheit so I just say degrees
I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies
And end up being right more than the guy on channel five

He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke
Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy
On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five A.M.
Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens
Greeting all the viewers with a ""Hi-hi-hip-hello!""
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke

He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys

We came at him with our sk8boards
He got a Pop Shove-It to the lip
I did a McTwist and landed on his wrist
And knocked the rifle right out of his grip
Cremator did a Blunt Slide off his back
Switching to a Disaster Grind
The Ghoul Hunter racked by our Ollie attacks
Was beginning to lose his mind
He had one more trick up his sleeve
A smoke bomb he quickly deployed
Once again he escaped, but not before getting scraped
A pastime we've come to enjoy

Vengeance he vowed to exact and employ

Just me waking up is me getting down
Spinning like a tilt-a-whirl
Sitting on top of the world

I ain't saying that stuff is bad
But it's so low compared to the highs I have
Counting my blessings, kicking back
Sipping on sweet tea in a glass
And watching my baby laugh
Don't get much better than that

That's why
I'm high on life
Oh, high on life"

Straight into the pale moonlight, make believe of course
But what's a little girl of eight
Supposed to do when she's up so late
She can't sleep 'cause it sounds like hate
Coming from her momma and daddy's room

Ride on, come on
Back to how it was before
Your momma left and your daddy cussed
All they ever seem to do is fuss, ride on

He keeps it ready on the launching pad
'Cause there've been times that he has seen,
An alien invade his dad
So he heads out for the stars
Past the moon and straight to Mars
But what about the invisible scars
That come in a bottle that his daddy brings home

Out to where it don't hurt no more
Ride on, come on

Your momma left and your daddy changed
You don't even know who's to blame, so ride on

Some people just lose control, some people hit overload
Some people act like some people, they never thought they'd be
So why can't we all see
The only antidote, The only way to cope
The only true hope is love
So everybody won't you,
[Chorus]
Ride on, ride on
Out to where it don't hurt no more
Ride on, come on
Back to how it was before
Go ahead and test your faith
There's still a lot of hope, it's never too late
To ride on the wings of love, ride on"

And a couple or two or three
went on a spree one day.
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew,
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay.
We visited McCann's, McLemann's, Humpty Dan's;
We then went into Swann's our stomachs for to pack.
We ordered out a feed, which indeed we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack.
Johnny McEldoo turned red,white, and blue
[original seems to have been ""as blue as a Jew],
And a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight.
He shouted out ""Encore"" with a roar for some more
That he never felt before such a keen appetite.
He ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram,
But him we couldn't ram though we tried our level best,
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot, and he still stood the test.
He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard. We got scared,
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill.
We told him to give o'er but he swore he could lo'er
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill.
He nearly sucked a trough full of broth. Says McGrath,
""He'll devour the table cloth, if you don't hold him in.""
When the waiter brought the charge McEldoo felt so large
He began to scowl and barge and his blood went on fire.
He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair,
And to finish the affair, called the shopman a liar.
The shopman he drew out and no doubt he did clout,
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football.
He tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He'd have killed him with a few blows in no time at all.
McEldoo began to howl and to growl by my soul,
He threw an empty bowl at the shopkeeper's head
It struck by Mickey Finn, peeled the skin off his chin,
And the ructions did begin and we all fought and bled.
The Peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five.
At us the made a drive, us all to march away.
We paid for all the meat that we ate, stood a treat,
And went home to ruminate on the spree that day.

I feel that it must be told, 'til now no one's ever heard
Somewere in time there's a school, a boy went there to read and write
You were nobody's fool, you quickly learned the game and how to fight
Then when he was ten years old his parents got divorced
Father was so cold and mother was so forced
It hurts so bad inside, he thought it was all his fault
He discovered it was a lie, all the things he once was taught
Tomorrow's child he cries
But only in his mind
He gets so cold inside
He leaves his ones behind
Today he's a full grown man
Wife & children and a piece of land
He's got a steady job, no trouble in the way
Suddenly there she stands, again in love he takes her by the hand
He tries to tell his wife, he wants this woman to stay in his life
Tomorrow's child he cries
But only in his mind
He gets so cold inside
He leaves his ones behind
This is not the curse of God, nor of the accuser
It's the curse of mankind that makes him an ordinary loser
The older says: you can go to hell
The younger says: she's crazy
He loves them both, they know this well
Pride hold them back, they lose him
Women of this world today
Don't wow this world away
A man is fertile all his life, this need is not right to deny

The boar is dead

They'd been asleep when his sun roared
He walked through night, walked through day

""Why should we let you by?""
The road is blocked by men of three
""If you need ask, you already know""
They said to let him pass, to leave him be
At the shores of sorrow
How far he'd come (to see her eyes)
(After) Moons and more moons
He'd be there tomorrow

Tired and smiling he falls, downwards he goes

Surrounded by candles on the black altar
Companions and brothers, I want you on my side
Be ready now for our ritual shall begin
""Are you ready to become the Bride of Evil?
Are you prepared to receive my Dark Powers?""
""Don't let my beauty die away
Like a dead dry teal
Come to me, give me immortality
...Here on this black altar
I make my promise of faith!""
He's coming closer, and pierces her neck
With passionate inhuman fury
The cuts his pulsing veins
And makes her drink his precious blood
The two minds fight and dance together
A frenzied dance of secret love
""Under this ivory fullmoon
I rise now immortal!""
Now reborn with dead indifferent eyes
Join me night creature in my Anthem of Glory!
""Lord of Darkness,
Your obscure gift made me Undead
In crimson passion we'll live together
Screaming in filth
Forever damned!!!"""

A brighter star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star is what you are
The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
you must have strayed from the milky way
A fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine

You chose a life of betrayal

Your rise and demise, I shall bear witness
There is no point in your existence
You put a price on all your friends
Now tell me was it worth it in the end?
You turned your back
on everyone that ever cared for you

In the month of May
A burly bum came ahiking
Down a shady lane
Through the sugar cane
He was looking for his liking
As he strolled along
He sang a song
Of the land of milk and honey
Where a bum can stay
For many a day
And he won't need any money

The bulldogs all have rubber teeth

The barns are full of hay

Where the sleet don't fall and the wind don't blow

There's a lake of gin
We can both jump in
And the handouts grow on bushes
In the new-mown hay
We can sleep all day
And the bars all have free lunches
Where the mail train stops
And there ain't no cops
And the folks are tender-hearted
Where you never change your socks
And you never throw rocks
And your hair is never parted
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
Oh, a farmer and his son,
They were on the run
To the hay field they were bounding
Said the bum to the son,
""Why don't you come
To that big rock candy mountain?""
So the very next day
They hiked away,
The mileposts they were counting
But they never arrived
At the lemonade tide
On the big rock candy mountain
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees

Where the sleet don't fall

3. In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
You never change your socks
And little streams of alkyhol
Come trickling down the rocks
O the shacks all have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And ginger ale too
And you can paddle
All around it in a big canoe

As soon as they put you in.

No axes, saws nor picks,

Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk

""Woe to him whose heart is filled with bitter rue and who drowns in grief""
In the silence of the night I loose myself,
it makes me drunken with its sweet blue sound.
In the drunk'ness of solitude
I fear no more the solemn realms of death
No single sigh from my lips as I drink the wine of bitterness
My heart is aching nevermore
for I know that all may end
Just I and the poetry of the night
Now forever one....
Just I and the poetry of the night, now forever one,
The ensemble of silence plays so beautiful for me..."

Swayin', and prayin'

Oh baby don't it feel so right,

Just stayin' in these arms of mine,
Wrapped up tight just swayin'

And baby all I wanna do, is keep

Binds the world in a feeling all familiar
'Cause everybody owns the great ideas
And it feels like there's a big one round the corner
A tenner, up and out into New York
Somewhere in all that talk is all the answers
And oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk
It's the modern road where folk are nice to Yoko
Every bone of rivet steel, each corner stone an anchor
Jenga jutts and rusty water tower, pillar-posted sign
Every painted lining battered, like a building in this town
Sings a life of proud endeavor and the best that man can be
Me, I see a city and I hear a million voices
Planning, drilling, welding, carrying their fingers to the nub
Reaching down into the ground, stretching up into the sky
Why? Because they can, they did and do so you and I could live together

A little monkeyshines
But the kind of row I can really hoe
Is playin' in tune on time
With rhythms all around us
We're like weavers at the loom
So pass the jar and that old guitar
In this hangdog hotel room
Oh Lord it feels so good
To play a nighttime tune
So pass the jar and that old guitar
In this hangdog hotel room

And goin' out at night

Is rubbin' the wrong girl right

Her nightmares and secrets washed away.
The past won't escape with your tears forever encased in hollowed out soul.

Shrouded in the thin haze
Of hot breath wheezing from
Dying lungs
Greasy hair covers
Wild blood-shot eyes
Dirty toes poke through
The ends of weathered
Combat boots.
Somewhere in this city
An old man's all alone
Standing on a corner
In the middle of the night.
Reaching in the pocket

Skeletal hand crucified by arthritis
Clench a half-filled bottle of
Fortified wine
A stream of drool
Runs from the corner of his mouth."

Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,

Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,
Speak a language that the strangers do not know.
Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.

And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,

Alive is afoot.....
Magic never died.
God never sickened;
Many poor men lied
Many sick men lied
Magic never weakened
Magic never hid
Magic always ruled
God is afoot
God never died.
God was ruler
Though his funeral lengthened
Though his mourners thickened
Magic never fled
Though his shrouds were hoisted
The naked God did live
Though his words were twisted
The naked Magic thrived
Though his death was published
Round and round the world
The heart did not believe
Many hurt men wondered
Many struck men bled
Magic never faltered
Magic always led.
Many stones were rolled
But God would not lie down
Many wild men lied
Many fat men listened
Though they offered stones
Magic still was fed
Though they locked their coffers
God was always served.
Magic is afoot. God rules.
Alive is afoot. Alive is in command.
Many weak men hungered
Many strong men thrived
Though they boasted solitude
God was at their side
Nor the dreamer in his cell
Nor the captain on the hill
Magic is alive
Though his death was pardoned
Round and round the world
The heart did not believe.
Though laws were carved in marble
They could not shelter men
Though altars built in parliaments
They could not order men
Police arrested Magic
And Magic went with them,
For Magic loves the hungry.
But Magic would not tarry
It moves from arm to arm
It would not stay with them
Magic is afoot
It cannot come to harm
It rests in an empty palm
It spawns in an empty mind
But Magic is no instrument
Magic is the end.
Many men drove Magic
But Magic stayed behind
Many strong men lied
They only passed through Magic
And out the other side
Many weak men lied
They came to God in secret
And though they left him nourished
They would not say who healed
Though mountains danced before them
They said that God was dead
Though his shrouds were hoisted
The naked God did live
This I mean to whisper to my mind
This I mean to laugh with in my mind
This I mean my mind to serve 'til
Service is but Magic
Moving through the world
And mind itself is Magic
Coursing through the flesh
And flesh itself is Magic
Dancing on a clock
And time itself the magic length of God."

Until they came where Jesus lay,
And when they came unto that place

Grow your own backbone hold your own and stand alone
Why pretend and be content with all the hate you hold innate
Pull your weight, it ain't too late to recreate your inner state
Discontent with time ill spent time has come and time has went
Now you vent while you torment why resent ? misrepresent
The scene between the lean and mean serene, extreme, the American

Live alive revive and thrive on life deprived as I survive
I'm fuckin' pissed off I used to be so angry
I'd disagree with anything that went against inside me
But things have changed I've rearranged in exchange for all the
pain
I kept inside and tried to hide denied and lied, but kept my pride
By my side in good supply all the while, hostile
And senile, I never smiled at anyone but now I'm done

Almost scared me half to death
When they said ""It's a boy again""
I walked in just in time to see them lay him by her side
And when she looked into my newborn brother's eyes
Mama cried
When I was just a teenage boy a preacher man stopped by
He asked me if I knew the Lord
Said ""If you don't, then tell me why""
I gave my heart to God that day, and then I was baptized
And when I stood up at church to testify
Oh, Mama cried

When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes

Standing in the high school gym decorated blue and white
And when they called my name out loud
You'd thought someone had died
'Cause when we sang the Alma Mater one last time
Oh Mama cried
Dressed up in our Sunday best, the family gathered 'round
Me and brother standing there with our heads bowed down
Flowers on the alter and a lady dressed in white
And when the preacher said ""Son you can kiss your bride""
Sweet Mama cried

And I swore I'd be there 'til the end,

I climbed out limbless to the ledge,
To bask in my last true regret.
Lay my heavy head here down to sleep.
Now pray to a abraxas for my soul to keep.

Wake up with this lead poisoning.
Sobbing softly,
Lost and hollow.
This fever dream,
Tough pill to swallow.

You're better off your bitterness.

I waved goodbye and leapt I

Lay my heavy head here down to dream.
Awaking to the blood and sweat and screams.
Woke up here on Monday morning,
This old treat on this dark corner,
Waiting here for what tomorrow brings.

Waiting for a bullet train to bring me my lead poisoning.

And that inside you the embers still glow
But I'm a shadow, I'm only a bed of blackened coal

I want to go with you and leave this country
To leave my fathers dwelling, this house and the land
So away goes Jamie with his love in his arms
They go over hills and the mountains and glens
Traveling all through the night in the mist in the rain
But her father has followed and has taken his men
And he captured poor Jamie with his love in his arms
Now home she was taken to her room she is bound
While poor Jamie lies on the cold stoney ground
And he knows all the while before the judge he will stand
For the stealing of nothing but his own true love's hand
In the cold hard iron his hands they are bound
Handcuffed like a murderer and tied to the ground
And the goaler tells Jamie ""last night I did hear
That your Lady will hang you or else set you clear""
The judge says ""this young girl being tender in youth
If Jamie is guilty she will tell the truth""
Then the radiant beauty before him did stand
""Oh I'm happy to see you my bold Irish lad""
But the father cries out ""Lord have pity on me
For the man came to bring disgrace to my family
And he stole my only daughter, all part of his plan
And if you don't hang him I will quit the land""
But the daughter is crying and begging is she
""The fault isn't Jamie's the blame lies with me
I forced him to leave and run away with me
And I'll die if I can't save my bold Jamie""
""Good Lord he has stole all her jewels and her rings
Gold watches and amber, all my precious things
And it costs me a fortune in thousands of pounds
And I'll take the life of Jamie before I lie in the ground
""Good Lord I gave them as a token of love
An when we are parted I'll have them removed
But a true lovers token wear on your right hand
And think of me darling when you're in a foreign land"""

I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Well I took my Geiger and I started to climb
Right up to the top where I thought I'd find
A hunk of rock that would make it click
Just like I'd read about Vernon Pick
On the second day, I made the top
And I'm tellin' you, Steve, I was ready to stop
The only clickin' that I heard that day
Was the bones in my back that had gone astray
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Uranium fever is spreadin' all around
With a Geiger counter in my hand
I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Well, you pack up your things
You head out again
Into some unknown spot where nobody's been
You reach the spot where your fortune lies
You find it's been staked by 17 other guys
Well, I ain't kiddin', I ain't gonna quit
That bug's done caught me and I've been bit
So with a Geiger counter and a pick in my hand
I'll keep right on stakin' that government land
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Uranium fever is spreadin' all around

An hour and forty five minutes late
And of course our connection was already in the air
Spent a day of our vacation in Chicago O'Hare
And like musical chairs at the baggage belt
We were the last ones standin' there when nothin' came out
Looking back now on our string of bad luck
That just wasn't our day but you know what?
That one night in Las Vegas
Lyin' there with you
Was well worth everything that you and I went through
And so it goes, our life's been that way
Puttin' out fires, takin' it day by day
And look at this year, it's been our hardest one yet
Just when we thought it had gotten bad as it could get
You got transferred to Denver, I stayed behind
Put the house on the market 'bout went outta my mind
And your dad got sick, I've never seen you so scared
We almost didn't make it through the year
But that weekend in the mountains
In a cabin all by ourselves
Makin' that one memory made up for everything else
Oooh me and my insecurities
You and your stubborn pride
If we've learned anything it's there's no winner when we fight
So this mornin' in our kitchen
After talkin' all night long
We finally stopped tryin' to figure out
Who's right and who is wrong
And when you hold me like you're holdin' me
And I kiss your tired face
We know we took the long way here
But wound up in a better place
Baby one night in Las Vegas
Or one weekend in the mountains
Any moment we're together makes up for everything else"

Desperately I have searched for a meaning
Is it now time for me to let go of the world

Seemed so certain, I thought it was mine
That was where and how I would be living
A complete human being with a soul
That was only a dream in a nightmare
And the nightmare is where I now live
Empty life, empty hours without meaning
Hours of madness that make me let go of the world
The revelation of my transformation
Is both a shock and a comfort to me
Leaving behind their conventional wisdom
Their rules that govern the way I should be
The narcissist and the father believing
That they should be worshipped and obeyed
By the lost overwhelmed and bewildered
But for me it is time to let go of the world
Why should I live by rules that I did not make?
So that people I don't know will accept me
I don't care who they are
These hypocrites preaching all of this nonsense
Reject me, they don't know who or what I am

Trying so desperately to get his attention
she says, ""honey, you're a bastard of great proportion"".
He says, ""darling, I plead guilty to that sin.""
With potatoes half way to his mouth
He looks her in the eye and says,
""without a doubt

What does she gain by all this sulking?
What trouble can there be for one so young?
Dark tension building like the clouds of a storm
Her daughter's in her room and she's at the door
Trying to figure what all this fuss is for.
she says, ""mother, you're a witch
And I'll always hate you.""

You speak are true.""
She quietly moves towards the bed,
Look her in the eye gently says,

Mysteries keep piling like dirty clothes

When through the gloom you hear
A familiar voice say....

Begging me to come back but I don't wanna try
Wasted all this time believing all you spoke
Now I'm sittin' here with all the pieces that you broke
I don't have the hope, I used to have in the past
Tell B.O.B. our airplanes just crashed and you can sing about it

You said that this was infinite
I swore it was a drug
I think that we are confusing the lust with the love

But when I asked her for a date to show me around
She said the folks say I'm no good our romance wouldn't last
I said if it's all right with you we won't bring up the past
I know I'm no angel I won't pretend to be
If I'm good enough for her she's good enough for me
Let them stare and criticize I love her I don't care
By her side I'm satisfied and so happy there

They won't be too quick to judge the wrongs of someone else
When they undestrand the truth we love each other so
Then perhaps they won't be careless with the stones they throw

Alas for woe! Alas for woe! -
It is high time to see the foe
To know the law does claim your soul
Alike the mute and helpless doll
Thus claim you for its very own.
However the shadows grew longer and longer
As evening fell - don't go beyond the last house
Your village remindeth me an island in billow
Of pestilent breeds have been running 'gainst us
Ye shalt die
Well to be sure!
But whilst ye are drowning - ye need no cure
Don't implore
Don't supplicate
Ye shalt rot to the core before it's too late!
Ye regard this solace as amongst cavalcade...
Of ire and delirious barking at church
There is no need to go there without faithful torch
The murals of hers do encumber to see
There is only one way to contumacy
Down the face!
The face of yours
Come closer to the grace like that
Shut it so close...
As ye can...
Imbrue her hills
The harridan's corpse was entwined 'bout by the...
Great worm's asp alike
That's your funeral... Hih!
Lo, Thou hast procured her fragrant
Thou didst debar her insolent folks
And as ye look through those mirrors on her walls
There are gargoyles flit ye about!
What were ye looking for?
What were ye looking at?
When this ae had been found by you
Had ye expected thing like that?
Indubitable ae's deep coomb alike
Darken the murals - do not see the light
Under palatial family vaults
Lay open the graves... Let their prisoners rise!
Their eyne's dry...
More so than thine
Dauber of murals that shalt never shine
Solemn hues which nane wilt ever see
Thy art is the way to contumacy
Hath anyone e'er confined thy legacy?
Do not crepitate!
Soporific anthem is swimming so slowly...
It's protected by them
By the superstitions do rule everywhere
Can ye die?
I deem ye should give it a try!
Sylvan dark
Decrease the light
Shall ye fly towards the dawn o' total night?
Sleepwards red and feculent sky
Why have ye never read my rhyme?
But anyhow... ye should give it a try!
Abysm provideth thy fall
Abysmal mirrors on her walls
Thou shalt acquire their mercy back
If thou believe them - fall adown and break thy neck
For the sake of evil
For the sake of... I don't care
Why do ye always try to attain ""famine of yours"" so ye acquire your pain
Mortals! Why was your quest so discourteous then?
If ye might have seen whether gift would be sent down...
E'en my sight was aghast when that shining nail
Was being pierced through the chest of the mass... knife alike
If ye e'er want to see - do not look for your eyes. -
And then - in days of yore - ye may creep to and fro:

Shame, she never realized the light in your eyes
You're a child of light
You were born into a world that lives in darkness
You're a child of light
And you wear the thorn, anymore than man
As you grow old and wiser, you keep more to yourself
And when you are aware, your body glows
Keep a look to here, as you're walking through the night
They're hoping you might be the Holy Ghost
Do they ever understand the light in your eyes?
You're a child of light

You can't shoot me down 'cause you've already knocked me dead

He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singin' songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in boulder I don't know
It was out in arizona
That he heard the lady listenin'
To each word that he was sayin'
To each line that he would write
So he sat down by her table and
They talked about the weather
Ninety-eight point six and risin'
Down by boulder dam that day
And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the mornin' sun
Back in boulder he had told her
""I don't know when I had a better friend""
Now he's traded off his martin
But his troubles are not over
For his feet are almost frozen
And the sun is sinkin' low
Won't you listen to me brother

It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
And the folks we meet ain't always kind.
Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.
Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.
I have traveled across this land
Just a-doing the best I can.
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.
And the faces that I see
Are as worried as can be.
Looks like they've been wonderin', too.
Chorus
I had a buddy, way back home,
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Monterey,
And sometimes, when I've had a few,
His voice comes singin' through
And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day.
Chorus
If you see us passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too.
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor,
Lace 'em up, bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over you.
Chorus
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound,
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound."

Keepsake cunts cut full out easing puberty through

Now times nine or ten
Within this vice den called a soul
Dying resurrection
I dig deep to come again
The spasm of orgasm on a roll
I live the slow serrated rape
The bucks fizz of amyl nitrate
Victims force fed their own face
Tear stains upon the drape

To a warm summer's day
But to the letter, it is better
To lichen their names to a grave
Counting my years on an abacus strung
With labial rings and heartstrings undone

Possessed with levering hell's gates wide
Liberating knives to cut humanity slack
My ambition is to slay anon

Who lets me pray, a Gilles de Rais
Of light where faith leads truth astray
I slit guts guts and free the moistest faces
Corrupt the corpse and seize the choicest pieces
Her alabaster limbs that dim the lit carnal grin
Vaginal skin to later taste and masturbate within
""my heart was a wardrum beat
By jugular cults in eerie jungle vaults
When number thirteen fell in my lap
Lips and skin like sin, a venus mantrap
My appetite whetted, storm crows wheeled
At the blurred edges or reason 'til I was fulfilled
Whors d'oeuvres eaten, I tucked her into
A grave coffin fit for the queen of spades
She went out like the light in my mind
Her face an avalanche of pearl, of ruby wine
Much was a flux, but the mouth once good for fucks
Came from retirement to prove she had not lost her touch
I kissed her viciously, maliciously, religiously
But when has one been able to best separate the three?
I know I'm sick as Dahmer did, but this is what I do
Aah, aah, ahh, I'll let you sleep when I am through""
The suspect shadow sher they least
Expect my burning grasp to reach
The stranglehold, the opened arms
Seeking sweet meat with no holes barred
Rainbows that my razors wrung
Midst her screams and seams undone
Sung at the top of punctured lungs
I bite my spiteful tongue
Lest curses spat from primal lairs
Freeze romance where angels, bare
Are lost to love, blood loss, despair
I weep, they merely stare
And stare, and stare, and stare, and stare."

Above earth's lamentations
I hear the trumpets sounding strong
That hails a new creation
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear its music ringing
It ever echoes in my life
How can I keep from singing?
And though the shadows gather 'round
The endless song it giveth
My strength within and joy abound
The world of truth it liveth
Though dark the night and long the road
I hear the music ringing
And with such power and grace bestowed
How can I keep from singing?
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to this rock I'm clinging
How can I ever come to harm?
How can I keep from singing?
Then sings my soul with love profound
A fountain ever springing
Deep from the earth how sweet the sound
How can I keep from singing?"

Design of drowning the first born son of man
Hands of cold and empty condemning in bastard choice
These teeth of heresy speak of promised ruin
Bow before my vengeance
I am masked for death in rage of this worship of disease
In red skies my words are weapons of hell
Conjuration through this death of falling skies
Hatred swarms this lethal rage
This vision repulsed within guidance
Vulgar temptation in hands of two
These scars are worm as praise
Soft breast of virgin's touch
Deceit in the birth of lust
Adultery of the serpent has brought forth the birth of rape
Arise in anointed skin of chaos
Seething the priceless warmth of the butchering of god
Sickness returns in this baptized pool
Unholy rise in spear of lies
This blood pours from the rib of man
Empty oceans of drowned souls filter into the veins of god
Corrupt this bloodline to taint the righteous birth
Commence the worship of the sick
For this black sky shall vomit forth the dark
Arise from carcass of god
Chaos breaths in deathlike silence
Vision of war in desire
Eyes swallow all that deny"

So alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,

Far strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,
Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.
For strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
Storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.
Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
Still alive we feel the pain tonight,
Stars fall through blackened clouds, and dreams that miss rains,
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.

They burned down the gambling house

Pulling kids out the ground

We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds

And rambles somewhere in his mind
Mumbling 'bout the Civil War
And how we should have won
Settin' up his battle plans
On checkerboards at his command
Watchin' all his gallant kings
Go falling one by one
And son he'd say there's not much time

Yea we all had horses it was always a race
It was real important who got there first
We sneak along some of the old man's whisky just to quench our little thirst
Yeah we looked like a bunch of hon yaks but we could ride like Casy Tibbs
And we still had to learn how far we could go before we learned when to quit
Yea we scratched where it itches and clowned around
There wasn't nobody who could kick our hound
Just throwin' knives and shootin' guns generally have in a bunch of fun
Well the mommas all thought we were angels and hell we let 'em go right ahead
But the old man had a hew more savvy in him
And a feller had to be careful around him
Yea wars were fought on contact and the wild seeds were sown
And we always spent our money like we found it in the road
Well one thing lead to another and before we knowned it it was gone
But I'll give you a hundred dollars just to have some more of them goings on

Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours
Another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone
Keep a fire for the human race
Let your prayers go drifting into space
You'll never know what will be coming down
Perhaps a better world is drawing near
Just as easy it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
Go on and make a joyful sound
Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own

The time you go may lie a reason you were alive

And as we drew south the mist it came down.
The wooded ravine to the wandering stream,
The serpent he moved, but no-one would say.
The depths of the waters, the bridge which distraught us
And brought to me thoughts of the ill-fated day.
The temples were filled with the strangest of creatures
One played it by ear on the banks of the sea.
That one was found but the others they went under.
Oh the tears which are shed, they won't come from me.
The methods of madness, the pathos and the sadness,

Yes if I talk to him
I take him back again
I'm afraid to even answer the phone
Cause if I talk to him
I take him back again
So if he calls please tell him I'm not home
I tell my heart I'm better off without him now
But like the other times he change my mind somehow
He'd shed some tears and talk sweet talk I'm sure that I believe
But this time it's the end if he'll just let me be"

Why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree

Why I can't even count the good friends I've already lost
Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody PMS blues
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm PMS I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""I feel your pain""

Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to

And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee
""They call as I to thee""
And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful, ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies

Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
Lo! The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise
""Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone""
Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Rouge-filmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flirt through the shadows
Like a dream of (were)wolves in the snow
Under deadly nightshade
Still warmed with the kill's afterglow
Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
(Beneath the stars taste the death in me)
Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality

My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words Warm within like wine
""Let me come to thee
With eyes like Asphodel
Moon-glancing, loose desires free
To writhe under my spell""

Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets

Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus

Imparts the night to us"

Until a soothing breeze is putting me to sleep

But can't remember where they're from
They stare at me with hollow eyes
Still disappointment therein lies
I see nations birth and death
One thousand human lives
Begin and end
I see new religions are born
And they fall into oblivio
I witness the births of worlds
And the old ones wither away
New universes are created in storms of fire
The old ones are crushed inside black holes
I see my old life fading away
And a new one is about to begin
I see water sprig
From the well of truth
People congregate
With will to eternal wisdom obtain
Those with false hearts
That taste the water change form
To trembling vile creatures with their insides out
The others are reborn as gods
At the very back of the swarming crowds
I see my tense face, I'm eager with fear
I desire to know but I fear the same fate
The one of others that I just beheld
When monsters with false hearts have expired
And the new gods are sent to conquer the world
As the last one I stand alone by the well
With fear I put out my hands
To finally taste the truth about me
[Lead: Schalin]
With uncertainty I awake from my dream
What would have happened and who am I?
I seek but can not find the well of truth
And struggle therefore through my life
With fear and eagerness
To godhood or complete demise"

Well his right foot stomped the pedals and his left foot stomped the floor
His wrinkled hands would skip the keys that wouldn't play no more
He'd play Onward Christian Soldiers and the window panes would shake
When the man of 87 played his old 88
The piano sat in a corner on a sagging hardwood floor
On top was a frame I made for him with a picture of the Lord.
A faded baptist hymnal took it's place above the keys
We'd take turns sitting by him he'd nod we'd turn the page
Well the old piano's silent now it don't ring with joy no more
Except sometimes when the cat jumps down when there's someone at the door
I can see him up in heaven with a smile upon his face
When God and all the angels let him lead Amazing Grace"

Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sitting round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

I was hangin' round town just a spendin' my time out of a job and not earnin' a dime

I suppose you're a bronc rider by the looks of your clothes
I says guess your right there's none I can't tame
If its ridin' wild ponies that my middle name
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
He says he's a cayuse that's never been rode
The guy that gets on him is bound to get throwed
Throwed of that strawberry roan
Out in the horse corral standin' alone is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
Spavined old legs and small pigeon toes pair of pig eyes and a long Roman nose
Little pin ears and they're split at the tip a big forty four brand was on his left hip
So I puts on my spurs and I coils up my twine
Says to that stranger that ten spot is mine
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
I'll break him to saddle or break him my own
I'll ride him until he lies down with a grown
Bring on your strawberry roan
Then I puts on my blinds and it sure is a fight
Next comes the saddle I screws her down tight
Steps up aboard him and rises the blind get out the way boys he's gonna unwind
Shore is a broad walker he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings for to be on the fly
He's the worse buckin' bronco I've seen on the range

When hunger calls my weary footsteps home
The morning follows after
I swim the seas within my mind
The pine trees laugh green laughter

Come on in and let's burn one Cledus
No need to go to the record store

On my PC

Before my eyes could not believe my ears

He made me Conway Twitty's greatest hits
And threw in the Flock Of Seagulls for the flock of it
Time sure flies when you're burning one
It was three A. M. when I got home
My wife was mad at me
Till I gave her that CD
With a mix of her favorite songs
And I said
Lemme show ya how to burn one baby
No need to go to the record store
I found every song you're looking for on the PC
Even got me
No you won't ever find me downloading porn
Just Haggard and Jones, Limp Bizkit and Korn
And I could use some Brooks and Dunn
So Fire up the computer and let's burn one

A lotta Bocephus and a little Kid Rock
And like Toby says ""Get'chya some

I dreamt a dream the other night, jaysus I couldn't sleep a wink,
The rats were tryin' to count the sheep and I was tryin' to get off the drink.
There was footsteps in the parlour and voices on the stairs,
And I was climbin' up the walls and I was movin' round the chairs.
I looked out from under the blanket, and up at the fireplace,
There was the Pope and John F. Kennedy and Jack Charlton and the three of them were starin' in me face.
And suddenly it dawned at me, hey by God I think I'm getting the D.T.s,
When the Child o' Prague began to dance around the mantlepiece.
I went, goodbye to the port and brandy, to the vodka and the Stag,
To the Smithwicks and the Harp and the bottle, draught and keg.

Well I swore upon the bible that I'd never again touch a drop,
I tell ya my heart was palpitatin', I was sure it was going to stop.
And thinkin' I was dyin' I gave my soul to God to keep,
And ten pounds to St. Anthony to help me find some sleep.
I fell into an awful nightmare, and got a dreadful shock.
When I dreamt there was no duty-free in the airport down in Knock.
II dreamt Ian Paisley was sayin' the rosary and Mother Theresa was taking the pill.
And Frank Patterson was out of his head be God and he was singin' Spancil Hill.
Goodbye to the port and brandy, to the vodka and the Stag,
To the Smithwicks and the Harp and the bottle, draught and keg.
As I sat lookin' up at the Guinness ad I could never figure out
How your man stayed up on the surfboard after 14 pints of stout.
I dreamt I was in ecstacy in Heaven and agony in Hell, I was bored in limbo,
And then I was in purgatory as well.
And there was original sins and venial sins,
And mortal by the score.
So I tied barbed wired around my underpants and I flagilated myself on the floor.
Then I dreamt I was in the confessional box and the auld Bishop said to me, he said,
""Any impure thoughts my child?"" - the fuckin' barbed wire was killing me!
And then I dreamt I was in the jacuzzi with that auld hoor in number 10,
And then I knew that I'd never ever, ever drink again.
I went, goodbye to the port and brandy, to the vodka and the Stag,

For hope that's been left behind
Listen

Before this chance disappears
And try to hear
Whoa, oh, listen
Take one less step away

Welcome home I hear you say to me
A smile of lust set on your face
Passionate love is all i see
I feel as though we are one
And for the one who looked out for us
My brothers blood I hold dear to me
And for you both I offer my whole heart
We're all thats left of this family
Anxiously pacing, you show that you feel guilt
What has been done your eyes will tell
Piercing words go through my mind
And when I hear those words
I see blood in my eyes
Beneath the smile, the deception lies
I can see it inside, your fucking eyes
Now Im breaking down, and i am feeling
All alone, my thoughts are racing
And Im thinking what went wrong
And how to go on
Your lies make me feel betrayed by you
The truths not yet clear inside my mind
They are my family how could they do wrong
I prepare myself for confrontation
I say to her, what have you done
How dare you accuse me
I'd never do such a thing to you

Truth is the myth that mocks us.
Verification, the addendum of nothing.
Paradoxical irony.
The fools, content to live as numbers.
What is it, that holds their attention,
So far from the innate questioning?
Where do they live?
The infinity of wisdom could not scour
The shit from their eyes.

This world, bathed in the filth of stupidity.
Retarded humans, etching out their predetermined frameworks,
Created as a pathetic excuse for the unfounded purpose.
.... My disconsolateness reigns supreme ....
For mine shall be hidden.
I speak so that time may know I have spoken,
And not so that time is lost within my speech.

Three flowers he gave to me
He gave me the violet, the lily and the pink
But I refused all three
The violet I did not like
Because it fades so soon
The lily and the pink I did overthink
And vowed I would wait til June
For in June is the red, red rose
And that's the flower for me
Ofttimes Have I plucked that red rosy bush

Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'
Jeff Canady's comin' and he eats little youngin's
His wife is a witch and Jeff can switch
From a snake To a frog or an old mad dog
So you better leave him alone
My sister was a backward child she never walked a step
She crawled around the old home place and always needed help
At eight years old she never walked and never went to school
The teacher said she couldn't help she'd grow to be a fool
We took her to a fine surgeon he said dear folks I dread
The body's strong but her mind won't go it's something in her head
Now there was a bum who walked around way back in those days
And momma would say we'd better be good or he'd take us kids away
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'...
We sheltered Sis from snakes and frogs and when the mad dogs came
But the one thing that she feared the most was old Jeff Canady's name
One day old Jeff came down the road when sister played alone
She screamed and squirmed and then decided she was there alone
She jumped and ran to momma's arms as Jeff went on his way
But thank the Lord my sister walks until this very day
Guess old Jeff is walking yet down heavens lonesome mile
But beneath his beard I swear I bet he wears a great big smile

The grass is green on both sides of the hill, there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it, and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
And quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody will, there's no time to kill
If we had an hour glass to watch each one go by
Or a bell to mark each one to pass, we'd see just how they fly
Would we escalate the value to be worth its weight in gold
Or would we never know the fortunes that we had 'til we grow old
And do we just keep killin' time until there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it and probably always will

Tonight my heart is heavy there's not a tear left in my eyes
You see my dad just passed away and I've told him so many lies
There were fifteen of us in our family and not a dime did we see
So all alone there in the graveyard I had to dig my daddy's grave
As I dug my conscience hurt me and as I rise my shovel high
It seemed my entire life was quickly flashing by
I thought of how he'd beat me and I tried to make him mad
And I knew every lickin' he gave me hurt him twice as bad
I thought of how he'd leave us when our lunch was an empty sack
But I knew dad worked hard and for us kids he'd break his back
Then I thought of how we'd hurt him why I'd take his core anytime
Maybe I'd have a wreck and land in jail he'd be there to bail me out everytime
I'd stand up in the space and curse him then I'd I leave so I wouldn't see him cry
Then he'd fall on his knees and say dear God give my son another try
After the funeral was over and the coffin was laid in its place
They handed me the shovel and asked me to throw more dirt in his face

The sound of violence
It's a beat that
Makes us dance
You sway
And I follow your lead
Drained, like a landmine
Armed and primed
Your words,
They sound like mine
We all shall repent
What we've done
In time
Confession in real time
Lies could have been mine
Naked are words that
Are dressed up in truth
Light up with voices
Screaming your choices
All that was lost just
To keep you from harm
Spoken, like you told them, for all that I
Left was a battle that I'll never fight again
Show them we're above them,
For all that I have is heart unsure
If even time can mend"

Had the daylight hours but you wanted more
La la la la
But the time, the time has drifted away
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
As the days like the waves
Decisively pull us under
La, la, la la la, keep it on
Melt my plastic heart
Help me move on
And on, and on, on and on, and on

Theres romance from great distances
Theres been so many casualties
But I cannot wallow over these, oh no"

You can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone

I've been gone

Gone crazy, goin' out of my mind
I've asked myself the reason,
At least a thousand times
Goin' up and down this hallway
Tryin' to leave the pain behind
Ever since you left,
I've been gone
I never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
The things you said I never understood
Are now crystal clear
I never spent this much time at home

I'm looking through mirrors to catch the reflection that can't be mine

I'm painting by numbers but can't find the colors that fill you in
I'm not even knowing if I'm coming or going, if to end or begin
I believe in the immaculate conception
And I believe in the resurrection
And I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the elixir of youth
And I believe in the absolute truth
Yes I believe in, I believe in
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
I've fallen from favor while tryin' to savor experience
I'm seein' things clearly but it has quite nearly blown my mind

Everything is and that is why, it is will be the line
I believe in perpetual motion
And I believe in perfect devotion
I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the things I've never had
And I believe in my mum and my dad
And I believe in, I believe in
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
I'm skippin' the pages of a book that takes ages for the foreword to end
Triangular cover concealing another aspect from view
My relative motion is just an illusion from stopping too fast
The essence of being these feelings I'm feeling, I just want them to last
I believe in original sin
And I believe what I believe in
Yes I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the web of fate
And I believe, I'm goin' to be late
So I'll be leavin', what I believe in
There is no love in this world anymore

There is no breeze
Disquiet lurks in silence
By this place of power
Your sins must escalate
What has come before
And recurs perpetually
Is on it's way
Cherish each atrocity
Woodland dark surroundings
Ill lit by twin beacons
A black car approaches
With two men inside it
With the right temptation
Murder needs to prompting
The man riding shotgun
Has just killed his own son
To nurture the white worms
Still and isolated
The woodframe house stands vacant
Humans that once lived here
Can no longer be found
And yet all are present
Well fed and ghastly white
In the mound of moist earth
That sits just by the road
His rigid features inexpressive
He flings his son's blonde head upon the heap
This last act earns him his metamorphosis
For he who built the house is at the wheel
To nurture the white worms
Darkling souls, though larval
With each sin can mutate
Into something dreadful
Before dawn, you'll pupate
And feed on innocents
Nourished by more like you
To someday haunt the aether
In obscene evolution
The house is hell
With it's windows all agape
Through these come some worms
And they have sprouted wings
Fear is forever, the objective
To goad the rest of humanity
Into acts of pervert nature
And bring out the worm in all of us"

Only in morbid imaginings have I dreamt of this cremation
The joining of my ash to your unending tenure

Only this pittance of appeasement
To burn eternally in your loving arms
And to the dismay of my every thought
Does she look upon me in faces of aversion
Her breath, her grasp
Cauterizing the tears I have shed
Such multitudes of sorrow I would welcome
If it meant only your loving embrace

Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds

Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew

And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring

It right on the nose
But other folks say that it's like the sun
Well a long time ago daddy said to me 'son I'll help clear
Up the mystery - I'll give you a simple rule of thumb'
If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love
Now the dictionary won't tell you much - if love is the word
You're lookin' up
No I don't believe that definition's right
And the encyclopedia won't reveal the crazy way you start
To feel - kissin' on a moonlit summer night cause
If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love
So go on and say that love is a game - or maybe compare it
To a flame
Or say it's a medicine that heals
'cause a panel of experts could fight all night - and never
figure out which one is right
but they'd agree on how it makes you feel
If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

Oh no, he just could not be satisfied.
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run,
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun.
He met her at a night club, on the other side of town.
Somehow he could not resist her, she's the best he'd ever found.
She knows, she found her ticket to the other side.

His foolish ways seem harmless, but his world was so divine,
Cause at home they know his secrets, they've heard all his alibis.
As he tries to face his feelings, he can't justify his crimes,
Now comes the final ending, of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside.
He can kiss it all good-bye.

Stands the messengers of death

Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall'shorne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stands
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those died
With power they vield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the Gods to war
And they never return in shame"

And on the grand piano
His hands light as butterflies
He played for the rich and for the poor

Old ship lies rusted in the port

A journey too far, a whiff too strong
He didn't exist for anyone
Bow and stern all the wishes between
(Wishes to yearn)
The world outside is a dream
(A lone dream, long time gone)
And when the whole world's leaving
The music will always stay
And if a story's worth to tell
The end will be far away
The final notes lie mute upon the sand
And in this lonesome end
Final notes lie mute upon sand"

Your old cheatin' heart has finally caught you
A thousand times I told you that it would
A great big wall has come between us
And I wouldn't even love you if I could
So don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't
Don't think I still can't care cause I can't
Don't think my mind won't change cause it won't
Don't think I don't love you cause I don't
Well all my tossing and turning nights are over
I don't even feel a touch of blues
Once more I can see the sun a shining
Shining though I know I'm over you
So don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't...
Don't think I don't love you cause I don't
ONCE A DAY
(Bill Anderson)

When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a guy I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away
Lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day long
IF YOU BELIEVE

(Life's supreme reward receive if you believe)
Oh the promise of tomorrow will banish all your sorrow
No need to grieve if you believe
There will be a brighter future and a way prepared
To suit your every need if you believe
If you believe so will it be it's true for you it's true for me
Somewhere down that narrow road he'll relieve your heavy load
Life's supreme reward receive if you believe
If your life is not inspiring and your days are long and tiring
Rest receive when you believe
Nothing here below can measure up to heaven's lasting treasure
Be not deceived only believe
If you believe so will it be...

Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
For we got love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
And they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
And our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think they fell from the sky
They say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block...
Oh all around the house you can see little children play...
We're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33

And the lonely know my secret they know what I go through
There's a secret behind the smile you see...

Who've loved and lost their hearts so many times
I'm here in the world world of forgotten people
Where every heart is aching just like mine
Well I've loved and I'd been loved but I had the reckless heart
And the many dreams I had are torn apart

We both have a morning cup of coffee
And with tender love you reach and touch my hand
And my son comes in and says good morning daddy
And I say how's daddy's little man
Then I woke up from dreaming I woke up from dreaming
I keep dreaming you're not gone but I'd found myself alone
When I woke up from dreaming
We're both making plans for the future
Of the joy that we want to give our son
We'd say almost enough to buy a new home
A home filled with love and fun
Then I woke up from dreaming...

I remember them so clearly mom and dad loved them so dearly
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where I learned about salvation from the book of revelations
In an arbor by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Many times I have departed from the way of life I started
In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me
In brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where the mighty light of God's great mercy fload
There was prayin' shoutin' singin' till the country side was ringin'
Brush arbors by the side of the road

Spreading their sails alee
Down the Humber they do glide
All bound for the Northern Sea

A crew with hearts so brave
Going out to earn their daily bread
Upon the restless wave
And it's three score and ten
Boys and men were lost from Grimsby town
>From Yarmouth down to Scarboro
Many hundreds more were drowned
Our herring craft, our trawlers
Our fishing smacks, as well
They long did fight that bitter night
The battle with the swell
Methinks I see them yet again
As they leave this land behind
Casting their nets into the sea
The herring shoals to find
Me thinks I see them yet again
They're all on board all right
With their nets rolled up and their decks cleaned off
And the side lights burning bright
Me thinks I've heard the captain say
""Me lads we'll shorten sail""
With the sky to all appearances
Looks like an approaching gale
Me thinks I see them yet again
Midnight hour is past
The little craft abattling there
Against the icy blast
October's night brought such a sight
Twas never seen before
There were mast and yards and broken spars
A washing on the shore
There were many a heart in sorrow
Many a heart so brave
There were many a fine and hearty lad
That met a watery grave"

'Cause something's happened to my cat
That deserves some explanation
William Shakespeare's in my cat
My kitty is the bard
He used to be a playwright
Now he's digging up the yard
He's still a cat in most respects
He likes to meow and purr
But now I introduce him as the cat
That wrote Richard the third
I took him to see Phantom
He said it was quite nice
But he can't go see Miss Saigon

Chews on my socks while I'm asleep

I own the cat who wrote MacBeth
But if something's rotten in this state
It's just his fishy breath
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!
William Shakespeare's in my cat
He rarely ever talks
He makes his loudest statements
Standing in the litter box
He sleeps on all my shelves
And throws my books about the house
It doesn't sound like prose
When he bats a squeaky mouse
Sam Beckett's plays are witty,
Same thing for Bernard Shaw,
Oscar Wilde is pretty,
But none of them have paws
(None of them have paws)
William Shakespeare's in my cat
He chases bits of fluff
John Milton's in my goldfish
But I never liked his stuff
I'm thinking that Franz Kafka
Really came back as a bug
And I hope Andrew Lloyd Webber
Will stay underneath my rug
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!
Take it, Trevor!

She mumbles ""Iirngg"" in her sleep

But Irving has a hold on her that I can't understand
They'll always be together even when they're miles apart

Day by day by day
Well, you have never met a single soul
Who didn't feel the curse's toll
Who didn't wish that death would die
Maybe that's the reason why
And it hurts so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
So don't lose heart
Though your body's wasting away
Your soul is not
It's being remade
So don't lose heart
Don't lose heart
Your body will rise and never decay

These people treat us so unkind
Just want to taste the freedom one more time
Just want to leave it all behind
We sneak down the hallway, it's time for us to go
It's time for them to let us be
So close to heaven, I can almost see the light
A few more steps and we'll be free
Leave it all behind
Breaking out in silence
As we crawl beneath the gate
Run, run so much fun
Doesn't it feel great
Over the wall, the great escape
We pledge you this and vow
That you'll never, ever catch us
You'll never get us now
Breathing hard, we got to get away
Never going back to yesterday
Run and hide from the enemy
But you can't stop the both of me
Racing through the darkness
Ad we slice into the night
There's no one here to challenge us
Our freedom's now in sight
But something moves around us
They've seen through our disguise
Flashing lights surround us
They begin to multiply
Siren's wall, they're right behind us
But I know what to do
It's time for us to say good bye
Time to split in two
Returning there is not an option
We've never going back
You cage us like an animal

'Twas gazing all around me
When the Irish lad I spied
All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play,
When this young man arose and he gathered his clothes,
Saying, ""Fare thee well today"".
That's not the promise that you gave to me
When the first you lay on my breast,
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west.
Go home, go home, to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill,
And think upon your own misfortune
Which you bought with your wanton will."

Somewhere I lost connection I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand it looks like my plans fell through

There was Earnest Tubb Marty Robbins Red Foley

And then he showed me the Hall Of Fame
With all the gold guitars and fiddles hanging on the wall
And then he said ""Step over this way
There are some of your friends I know you'll want to see
They're waiting for you""
And there they were standing side by side smiling at me
Tex Ritter Johnny Horton George Morgan
Dottie West and Keith Whitley
And then he said we got a big show up here tonight
And we have saved you a seat on the front row
Ah I sat and watched and listened
As Grant Turner introduced an all-star line up
Like none I'd ever seen
Roger Miller opened the show with Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys
Followed by Webb Pierce followed by Hawkshaw Hakins
Red Slovine Carl and Pearl Butlerand Cowboy Copus
Lester Flat Stringbean Jimmy Gateley Mel Street
Jim Reeves and Patsy Cline
I saw all the stars in Country Music Heaven
Oh what a star studded night
Then I ask him who else he expected in the next say 100 years
Jimmy handed me a large book covered with stardust
He called it the big tally book
In it were many names
And each name was branded with pure gold
I began to read some of them as I turned the pages

Who are you, and where are you from?
Oh, stranger to our world
Answer, where do you come from?
Where have you been living the nightmare
Of these untold stories...?
And in which star have you finally found
The colour of our faded madness?
...""Where I come from? Where could I come from,
when my eyes, full of sadness and regrets,
look like two candles glowing

Behold, naked I am now, as I've trodden a long way
Where I've been encountering, one by one, all those,
- who wanted to sell jewels, that cannot be sold...
- who wanted to lead the world towards ""better times""
towards that distant horizon...
...within the eternal harmony between end and infinity...
""Where do I come from? I come from the world beyond horizons
from the world, where no one of you has ever been before!!!""
So open up the gates, gather all around me
And we'll walk together towards the world
Where no castles and bridges exist, nor feudal ditches...
Nor corroded bronze porches, which newcomers knock at
Arrive yet, while time's not up and you still may chant
Come now, let me set ablaze the xtinguished torches in your soul
Its phantasmagoria and the spell of new magiks,
And those chants, you're begging today for bread with
I shall put together with the glowing of 'morrow's aurorae...
Though, the gates are still closed to the chant of 'future art..."

we'd glide through life together
ignoring all passers by
was just killing myself believing in you
Challenge me

left to burn
destroyed with such precision
Still coping with the aftermath
and salvaging the remains that are left

And it's me and my bestest friends
Hit the town, put the week behind us
Rocking the same spots again and again
Feels like nothing will ever stop us
No rain or sleet or snow
Tonight there's not a cloud in the sky
While we cool outside on the stereo
We're always on a mission to finally get it right
The life of the party comes in bottles, cans, and pints
We talk about it, sing about it, sneak it onto planes
And every single week someone says the same thing
This has been a great night
No one got into a fight
Met some girls, saw a band
Everything went just as planned
The only thing that we forgot
Was stocking up by 12 o'clock
We'll never persevere
We've got friends, chicks, guitars, and no beer
We've been in this band
Longer than most of our fans have been
We get started up about 6 O'clock
And we go until most of us just can't stand
And it never ceases to amaze me
Just when things start to get good
Is this record on repeat right now?
Whoever hit the store must have misunderstood

You just exist till you've been kissed life begins at love

I softly pull its trigger to pierce his flesh.

My love for the gun grows stronger.
Dedicated to extinction.
My aim is as bold as his arrogance.
I smile proudly as he trembles in the line of fire.
The sight of a human spirit's weariness brings joy to this beholder.
Witness the priceless look on his face

Then go habitually insane
Resort to a life of crime or violent rapes
Assaulting police officers, in border towns
Extreme prejudism
From this rising plague
Infecting our youth
Change will commend
Arrests were made
Weed is slowly criminalize
State by state officials were terrified
Mostly minorities that smoked
Jazz musicians were being watched
Under section 2F
Possession without a prescription
Was made presumptive
Evidence of concealment
Drugs illegally imported
In violation of this act
And made possession a federal crime

Three inhalations of marijuana
The first puff
Induced feelings of well being
The second provoked extreme elation
Coupled with activity the third was reputed
To make the smoker oblivious to danger
Developing superhuman strength

A hot bed for marijuana fiends
Reportedly common
Not only among Mexicans
But among blacks, prostitutes, pimps
And criminal class of whites
Meanwhile alcohol prohibition
Was a losing cause
Government paranoia was soon abound
Mafia propaganda was gaining ground
Through violence and bribery
Alcohol could be found
By 1921 an increase of marijuana
Was noted Cannabis Indica
Which is Indian Hemp
From hashish to opium raise new fears
Cocaine in further demand
On July 15, 193O Harry Jacob Anslinger
Was appointed Acting Commissioner
Of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
Eager to fulfill his role as an evil crusader
Against the evils of narcotics
The influential of public policy
Toward drugs from 193O-1968
Employ every tactic possible
To convince legislation
Marijuana is a national monster
Boys smoke it with girls to seduce them
Still heroin use is rising higher
Public oppositions had very little say
I'm living here in 2OOO
And I have never smoked weed
That made me want to kill
Or become hostile
All these crimes
Must have been committed
Under the influence of alcohol
Smoking pot gets you stoned
You get mellow
So fuck the bullshit from the past
It is time to grow up
Out of religious pesting
Or goody-two-shoe politicians
Or lobbyist, addicted to tobacco

I'm going down by the jetty
Tonight the tide is high
It's tankers in the channel laying
Flames up in the sky
I'm going down by the jetty
(Be)fore I leave this world behind
'Cause that oil slick on the water
Is band to ease my worried mind
My face is slowly burning
My eyes are turning red
In the shadow of the refinery, baby
Tonight I'll make my bed
I'm going down by the jetty
(Be)fore I leave this world behind
(Fore I leave this world behind)
'Cause that oil slick on the water
Is band to ease my worried mind
- Harmonica and Guitar Solo -
The air is filled with poison
The sea is thick with grease
Somewhere in this hell on earth
I'll surely get some peace
With one foot on the water
And one foot on the pier
I'm ready for the next world
To get me outta here
I'm going down by the jetty
(Be)fore I leave this world behind
'Cause that oil slick on the water
Is bound to ease my worried mind
Bye bye, cruel world..."

They saw the beacon aflame,
Burning with sorrow for the lives that would be lost.
And the troops went ashore,
Sounds of drums filled the air.
Towards the city they marched.
Called all the young ones, called the old.
Summoned the people to stand up and be bold.
Fight a superior force for high society.
Sheltered behind the walls,
Holding the riches that forever could be lost.
Outside the city gates
The peasant army fights on
Towards their imminent doom.
Cross the Field of Sorrow children's soul still cry
As an echo from the blackened day.
Cross the Field of Sorrow
There are whispers and sighs
From burning anguish and dismay.
From the protection of walls
Beheld the blood stained plains
Reeking of sacrifice's shame.
Children and cripples of the battle that was lost.
Trembling hands open the gates
For the extortion of fire,
As they had nowhere to hide.
Fill up the barrels and chests with all your gold.
Build me a throne to rest upon.
Fear not the fate of the fallen,
Hear not the cries of the crows.
And so they sailed off with the gold.
In the midst of the sea
They were caught by a storm.
Both booty and crew's lying deep."

Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed.

He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall.
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love,
For that CHild so dear and gentle

There was only one long and terrible winter
Where icy blackness covered the sun and the grass

Hell brought there all the thunder and winds
All the blasphemy from the four sides of the world
Gods have forgotten this land, where fear
caught the throat with the bony hand
And the wolf howled gloomy song of cold, frost and hunger...
The lakes enslaved in hard icy shackles
Wild trees covered the happy world
Which will never wake up again!
Life has affected a new form here
Through the icy vastlands run wild
Hordes of wolves, moonless night, that's all

It calms me to know that I won't

Belief will always save me
Blood...swearing
Fear...staring

Give up on misery
Turn your back on dissent
Leave their distrust behind
Wash your hands of regret

Learning from misery
Staring back at dissent

and tell me what you see.
[XERXES:] I see a land far to the north... a vast empire of dark endless moors
and snow-crowned mountains... a land of brooding citadels and warrior-kings
who hail to grim gods.
[ALTARUS:] Look well, Xerxes, for enlightenment hides within the fog-swathed
vales of Hyperborea...
[The King's Dream:]
By the onyx sceptre of my forefathers, the air is churning with auguries
of dethronement... Impending dread thus prophesized! In a dream I was bade
ride the argent-eyed unicorn to the Ring of Stones... There a torrent of
viscid slime assailed me, as pipes and horns sang the clarion of my
dissolution... And the usurpation of my ancient azure throne. Assassins stalk
the nighted halls of my palace... poisoned blades and chalices surround me.
I thirsted for a balm, but my thirst was slaked by an envenomed draught. My
swordarm shackled by tendrils of sloth... enthralled by the chasmed gloom...
Borne upon wings of labyrinthine dread... I awaken! I shall seek the counsel
of the sorcerer, keeper of the ancient scrolls of wisdom, and the Crystals of
Power...
[The Words of the Sorcerer:]
My liege, great and regal king... the mists disclose their secrets... you
are destined to wield a great dark power. Drink deep of the potions of the
apothecary, for upon thee now I bestow a shard of the mystic Crystal of
Mera... sacred artefact of the At lantean mages, won in battle by our legions.
My liege, the Crystal of Mera shall unveil the truth lurking hidden in thy
most fever-haunted dreams...
[The Voice of the Harbinger:]
The land awash with spilled blood, and viscera torn forth from the
sundered dead... Gorge the earth with flesh darkened with the claw and fang of
war... rent open the ravenous maws of worms...
[The King:]
The Crystal illumines dark secrets, the truth is known... a dire and
ancient threat is ranged against me. Hearken, the clarion is upon the winds,
now the call to arms is upon us all, Grim warriors, take up thy spears and
hone thy gleaming swords. Archers, string thy bows, brave knights, saddle the
steeds of war, The glory of battle is nigh at last, our banner shall fly this
day in victory!
My warriors, a legacy shall this day be wrought by our blades, decreed by
the gods, Blessed by the blood of vanquished foes. Our destiny beckons...
[Lord Angsaar, Dark Liege of Chaos:]
Come, great king of Hyperboria, march against me with your splendid
legions and shimmering swords. I, the Bane of the Atlantean Kings, the Scourge
of Lemuria, Archfoe of the Immortals of Ultima Thule, shall Crush you! I shall
visit a thousand plagues upo n your realm, and wreak untold havoc and bloody
carnage until I have your throne... and your soul!
[ALTARUS:] And thus, flanked by the splendour of azure banners, a vast army
marched forth from the great walls of the Imperial City of Hyperborea, and at
the forefront of the mighty legions, astride an ebon war-stallion, rode the
king, sunlight glinting up on his splendid armour... compelled by dreams, and
guided by the Crystal of Mera...
[XERXES:] Where? Where did the king's path take him?
[ALTARUS:] The king was compelled to lead his forces to the shadow-haunted
Mountains of the Dead, a grim and brooding place steeped in dark and ancient
legendry. Alone he rode into the gaping maw of a huge cave hewn into the side
of the tallest mountain co untless ages past by unknown hands. For three full
days and nights he did not emerge from the cave... until, at last, he rode
forth from the eldritch mountain once more, a terrible knowledge shadowed in
his icy eyes, and bearing in his gauntleted fist a huge black sword, a
magnificent ebon blade which no human blacksmith ever forged. Fearsome
sorcerous power crackled within the yard of black steel, dancing upon its
searingly honed, glyph-scored blade... and its bejewelled, dragon-carved hilt
did whisper arcane secrets to the king in a strange, elder tongue.
[XERXES:] But master, what powers did this blade possess? What secrets did
it hold?
[ALTARUS:] Many centuries ago, before even were waged the Great Wars
between the ancient kingdoms of Atlantis and Hyperborea, Lord Angsaar did rise
from his charnel-tomb and do battle with a powerful immortal warrior-shaman
over the possession of the elder Crystals of Mera, mystic gems of unparalleled
magical potency. Angsaar, his power swelled by forces from the vast Outer
Darkness, did smite his foe to the brink of destruction... but, with his
fading sorceries, the immortal mystically transferred his li fe-essence into
his great black sword, and scattered the magic crystals across the galaxy,
leaving Angsaar with a hollow victory and forcing him to return once more to
his dark Chamber of Slumber. The sword was lost for centuries, as were the
crystals, u ntil the one gem to remain on this world was discovered deep
beneath the northern seas by an ancient Atlantean wizard. And the sword...
legends spoke of how its final resting place would be made known by the
sorceries of the last crystal only when the bl ade's power would once again ne
needed to battle the Chaos-liege. This was the immortal's final, most powerful
spell... upon the reawakening of Angsaar, the sorcerous energies and undying
lifeforce encased within the blade would be transferred to its wie lder...
aye, the one who discovered the Shadow-Sword would be imbued with the power of
the immortal, and by the art of elder spellcraft, he would do battle with his
ancient nemesis once more...
[XERXES:] Then there looms such a cataclysmic battle!
[ALTARUS:] And so, from his Black Citadel, the Chaos-liege did send forth
his Horde of Wraiths to engage the army of the king...
[THE KING:]
Behold, a legion of undead fiends meets us upon the field of war. Face
me, Scourge of Lemuria, I wield thy bane, the Shadow-Sword... (and darksome
sorceries now empower me with thunderous might!) Hearken, the clarion is upon
the winds, now the call to arms is upon us all, The glory of battle is nigh at
last, into the fray we ride!
[XERXES:] The outcome, master... who left the field victorious? Did the
king prevail?
[ALTARUS:] The mists begin to disperse... for now, the images fade. That
tale shall have to wait 'til another day...

And talks with the west have turned sour.

The leaders are waiting for blood on their hands.
Playing with weapons they don't understand.
Could it be this time we'll see the end of the world.
Each day brings a new danger
Love is a stranger we used to know.
Outside, the sun goes on rising.
But we're realizing there's not long to go.
The storm clouds are forming
Take held of the warning to come.
The Kremlin has told every nation
There's no place to run.

Growing stronger with each passing hour.

Terror on the high seas wrought by Charles Gibbs
Brandishing his sword in pirate fame
For wealth that surfed the currents between the old world and the new
Countless were the victims that he claimed
A modus operandi of debauchery and greed
No prisoners were the words of his command
A cruel and vicious person with a gross incessant need
To claim the life of every single hand
Chorus
They would hoist their mighty sails under the black flag
Catch a trade wind to their date with infamy
On a mission to destroy every time that they deployed
They lived a vile evil life of treachery
He sailed the Florida Straits searching for his prey
Stealing all the treasures from their fold
This madman on a mission would abscond with what he claimed
Pavilion key was where he stored his gold.
His ship would pull along side and tie their ropes to fore and aft
They'd swing aboard with lust and greedy hearts
They'd rape and murder woman and torture all the men
Then throw their bloody carcass to the sharks.
Repeat chorus
Sax solo
To romanticize a pirate is to make a mockery of life
The Dark ages from our past in maritime
But good traverses evil, so let the record show
Charles Gibbs was hung at the age 29
Repeat Chorus"

Friends lose touch, people age, and family moves away

Granny made it back in sixty-eight and gave it to my mom
Who gave it to her uncle who gave it to her son
Who then gave it to me and that is where it stuck
For I was only three months old and clearly out of luck
Each Christmas of my childhood that fruit-brick would return
My mom would place it on a plate and tell me I must learn
That it is rude to get a gift and not put it to use
And every year I'd take a bite and chip another tooth
After fifteen years of misery I'd had all I could take
That summer I went camping and dropped it in the lake
I thought that I was rid of it, but on Christmas eve
There it was ""from Santa Claus"" under the Christmas tree
Each year I'd try to lose it but it would just return
So I cried out ""oh why have I been given such a burden?""
A voice replied, ""it's not a curse, but the greatest gift""
""For when all else abandons you, you will still have it.""
For all of man's creations slowly waste away
Relationships do crumble and buildings do decay
The pyramids and stonehenge slowly disappear

Ten dollars can go so far, you'll see us spend it at the bar
Buy our tapes or our CDs, we'll pay the GST
Got no cash, what the heck, we'll even take a cheque certified of course....

Below the lights
If you came upon a door
If you came to push it open
If your eyes could see within this dark
Your heart would flee
Nails and blood
Painted by delirium
You would feel the empty stare
From a darker place
Silent screams
From ages in the void
Desperation
The voices fill your ears
Head back into the light
Never to return
This dream will haunt you
From a darker place
Behind the walls

The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true, I love you.
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all.
Now I feel ten feet tall.
Sunny one so true, I love you.
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see.
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to C.
My life was torn like a windblown sand,
And the rock was formed when you held my hand.
Sunny one so true, I love you.
Sunny, thank you for the smile upon your face.
Sunny, thank you for the gleam that shows its grace.
You're my spark of nature's fire,
You're my sweet complete desire.
Sunny one so true, I love you."

Trying not to spend more time looking back
There's still a bit more to go
Can't stop measuring strike outs to home runs
Trying to justify these compromises that have piled up and dulled my blade
Maybe we stayed too long didn't say enough, swing hard enough
The years just sort of ran away
And the ones that follow won't be as fun
I'll never love anything else the way that I loved this
So you know its not gonna be easy
To just let go
But the credits they will roll
It's getting harder and harder
To give too much of my body and soul to a mess overrun by morons and thugs
Who's only purpose is to break this, not hard enough to make it
Fighting on their own
We stand bound and gagged as they pee on our rug
The end result of not a single motherfucker willing to take the hard road
Makes it easier to watch as the door swings slowly shut
Then there are those I'll carry with me forever, live deep in my chest
Watched as you took your last breath on that floor in Wilkes-Barre
The room loved you so deeply our hearts broke as you faded
And i can never repay the lesson you left me as we rolled outta town that night"

Now that could be the voice of John F Morgan in the Ripley jailhouse singin' hymns

Cause this is gonna be a hangin' day for him
Now people say that Johnny was a bad man and that he had a aim for bein' mean
He took a hatchet one cold weary morning he killed two children and the widow Green
Five thousand people gathered there in Ripley invited by the sheriff Jay O Sean
Havin' fun and drinking moonshine liquor and listenin' to ol' Johnny singin' hymn
The day dawned cold in Ripley West Virginia the scaffold stood in silence in a field
Johnny kept on singin' in the jailhouse waiting there to eat his final meal
Then rumor started flying through the gathering
That John F Morgan might get his reprieve
The people started yelling toward the sheriff
Afraid they'd miss for all they come to see
But Jay O Sean the sheriff of Jackson County
Afraid that such a thing could have been done
Said I said there was gonna be a hangin' and I still mean it there's a gonna be one
They led John Morgan from the Ripley jailhouse
And he rode through the happy laughin' crowd
But when John Morgan stepped upon the scaffold
They grew quiet when he tip his hat and bowed
They listened to the preacher say the last words
They fixed the noose and tied John Morgan's hand
The signal came and someone sprang the dead's trap
And sent John Morgan to another land

On the sixteen of December in fifteen ninety seven

Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer
Will somebody take a stand
Against a system that's been designed to deny
Its victims their right to life
Let's set the captives free
When all is said and done, we'll see justice come
Its time to fight the silence (go)
The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence
Fight, fight, fight the silence
Its time to fight"

In Misery's dawn...

God's forgotten children struggle for their lives
While innocent convictors celebrate the knive
""I'll always be with you"" - But I've never really been
On your way back to the gallows, destiny's fulfilled
Misery's dawn
Can't you see?
Misery's dawn
Together from a black sea of stars we shall arise
To fall down once more, failure in disguise
In tragedy's harvest the fruit's a bitter loss
They broke your wings and make you tumble down... at any cost
You burned me with your poisoned seed of doubt
Why do you want me to suffer?
Is this the day of geaven or is this the day of pain?
I closed my heart forever as the blade slowly opened your veins...
Misery's dawn
Can't you see?
This is my private misery"

so I buried my father in a tomb of rocks,
a plot behind St. Catherines church
to lay rest the gilded dreams of pitiable men.
With gold found to the North,
Quartzburg drove out its whores,
its foreigners and roughnecks.
They settled this camp.
Pa left every day to mine.
Id follow him to the gulch,
my pan and shovel in hand,
a child devoted to riches.
The Mexicans often staged
bull and bear fights near the bar.
They kept a boy entertained
when there were no hangings to enjoy.
The Cantonese flooded the quarries,
working for less than the Whites.
My father would curse the Orientals,
yet came home reeking of opium.
A group of my friends and I
left to explore the creek.
The Chinaman kneeled there,
gleaning for gold.
We mocked him, and pushed him,
I prodded him with my knife.
He gripped his revolver
and fired in the air.
The errant bullet
ricocheted off of a stone
and grazed my leg.
I ran back bawling
to the town.
Mobs
surround
the crying Chinaman,
Father clutching the noose.
Law
arrived.
The sheriff demanded
that he be jailed and properly tried.
Gangs amassed
late at night
outside the jail.
Father led,
rope in hand,
prey in his cell.
Soothing lies.
Tempted with
tobacco leaves,
the Chinese
reached his arm
through the bars.
The lynch mob swiftly grabbed
the gleaners exposed hand.
Father wrapped the collar
around his neck.
The horde yanked on the rope,
Chinaman dragged and choked,
his brains dashed upon the wall.
Soon all the gold mines dried
but that blood never did.
Red still stains the jail cell wall.
Father was never tried,
none mourn a foreigner,
but I saw guilt in his eyes.
With all the riches spent,
the people left the town
yet I stayed to dwell here still.
When Father died of drink
I did not weep for him.
I pray the grave unburdens his sins.
I pray that someone will remain to bury me.
I pray that someone will remain."

Opened my eyes, and man, I swear

Saw a couple walking by, they were holding hands
Man she had that glow
Yea, I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melted into shades of red

And of the English armies,
That marched in for to stay.
Oh that night they wounded Old Ireland,
And she's bleeding to this day.
Their dogs of war were loosed to run
And hunt the rebels down
They hoped to rule this land by fear
And hold it for the Crown
But a mighty thought was born in Men
When they killed James Connolly
Oh that night they wounded Old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.
The Border lies like an open wound
That only love can heal
For bitterness and cruelty
They will never close the weal
The mean of vision built a dream
Which the blind men stole away
Ah that night they wounded old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.

That thousands more can see
Of Ireland free from hatred
And death and bigotry
Where Irishman to Irishman
Can in friends clasp a hand
If we banish fright from the Ulster night
Then we'll free Old Ireland."

And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve.

The good will that lasts til the Feast of St. Stephen
For that is the time to eat, drink, and be merry,
Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.

There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.
Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.
With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.
And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.

Illusions darks blossoms have grown.

The dance still is sung.

Decided by limits drawn
On charts of my past days
And pathways since I was born.
I carry the dust of a journey
That cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day.
You and I are yesterday's answers,
The earth of the past came to flesh,
Eroded by Time's rivers
To the shapes we now possess.
Come share of my breath and my substance,
And mingle our stream and our times.

Our reasons are lost in our rhymes.
Doubles faces dark defense
Talk too loud but talk no sense
Yeah I see those smiling eyes
Butter us up with smiling lies
Talk to creatures raise the dead

Trained apart from houses of stone
Hour of horses pick the bone
Come forth, from love spire
Born in life's fire,
Born in life's fire.
Come forth, from love's spire

For life to be.
And the pain will (must) be gain,
New life!
Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams.
They were, sent from (to) the gates
Ride the tides of fate,
Ride the tides of fate.

Enraptured by (the gleam of) moon-frost's caress,
My heart is held in icy thrall,
The horned moon's sweet enchantment,
The Topaz Throne is beckoning,
The jewelled sword awaits my grasp,
The dreaming gods now grimly brood in
The silence of Atlantean spires.
The sky is black with chaos-fiends,
Spellcraft rides with witch-storm's wings,
Beneath the vaults of time-lost tombs,
Sorcerers summon the Shadow-Kings.
All witches fly to me!
Witch of heather, moor and sea,
Come lay with me as twilight falls,
Grant me the black Elven sword
And the draught of immortality,
The scent of night about your flesh,
Enfold me in this mist of lace,
Your lips grow red by candlelight,
My beloved is raven-tressed.
The sky is black with chaos-fiends,
Spellcraft rides the witch-storm's wings,
Beneath the vaults of time-lost tombs,
Sorcerers summon the Shadow-Kings.
And now the blossoms fade,
Lost within your dark eyes (I drown within those ebon eyes)
The sweetest tears I taste (glistening upon your lips),
This ichor of your kisses...
Weave thy dark spells,

Witch-fire is glimmering through
Sunken marble halls.

Blood sates the Ebon Blade...

Words and music Chris Foster
The storm clouds draped on the horizon
An his love climbed the stairs so she could see
On the second story perch of her protection
She blew him a kiss as he wandered off to sea.
The captain told him be on board by morning
The catch is running now, he knew he had to go
In about a day she will see him coming home
Through the inlet where the boats go to and fro
I will wait for my love in the morning
I will wait for my love in the day.
From on top of the roof from my widow's walk
I'll be wishing all your stormy clouds away
Sailors dance on mother natures cool clear waters
Spend the springtime of their lives in her fold
Sailors songs have been sung for thousands of years
But the widows story's rarely ever told
On cold dark nights she'll linger up ---- to her rooftop
Grasp the wooden rail with boney shaky hands
The salty air caresses worried cheeks of sorrow
As she ask her God to help understand
I will wait for your love in the sunshine
I will wait for your love in the rain
From on top of the roof from my widow's walk
I will wait for my love to come again
Solo
The time has come and gone for him to be home now
Another sleepless night upon her breast
Maybe it's the season or maybe some bad weather
But either way I will not get my rest.
I will wait for my love in the springtime
I will wait for my love in the fall
From on top of the roof from my widows walk
I'll wait until I hear your angel call.

So this time I know my self right, I know my self well
I know my self

Sometimes I just can get it
Right,
Higher (so high to me)
And leave my hardtimes far behind
Higher (so high to me) and let the past dust flow away
So what about the passion,
Leaving the goodtimes into the badtimes
Gotta be strong to get out of it
I've been thru so many stuff that hurts I swear
Troubles melt with my life, handle my time,
Doing my best, that's what I want-
So this time I know my self right...

And to tear our home apart
Make our lives a livin' hell

And set them out to sun on our back porch
'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill
And when daddy got word of the revenue
He made us kids help hide his brew
Made us swear that we never knew
About daddy's moonshine still
Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line
Once a week with a load of moonshine
And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night
My two brothers lost their lives
And oh my god how I despise
My daddy's moonshine still

Well it broke mama's heart but she understood
The day that I left home for good
But I had to find me another way to live
Well I sent mama money nearly every day
And how I made it, well I'd rather not say
But at least it took me far away
From daddy's moonshine still
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well
And he made our home a livin' hell
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will

And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff

Souls under the serpents banner

Orgy of destruction - a ""gesture of might""
Gaze at the grey sky - hatred and poison
And from the vast towers of the underworld

Trample down bronze gate of tartaros
Patient earthly men with (raised) bloodfilled chalices

Goin' to where the freedom bells ring
Into the Highlands I must climb
On this journey, I have been here before
Tryin' to reach the other side

Without a mountain guide
Took such a while to find you
Oh, could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons
Up ahead, I know the trail way stops
From there on, only eagles fly
Burning with visions of the way back to you
They're burnin' through the eastern sky
Now and then I see a shooting star
Lighting up the silver blue
It's shining all the way down the mountain skyway
Oh, it's shining straight from you

Pressurized sealed in ward off the mounting days
Retain revived rebirthed beyond the grave

They merely can't afford this highest form of luxury

To carry on the will elite
To live again
Advancing through the centuries
Until the sky is black and the sun it never shows
Til the whipping winds of nuclear winter cruelly blow

A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered ""That's alright""
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I swear inside I feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
Rushing in long in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night"

This creates a streamlining of the views held by political hopefuls, forcing them to conform to the standard beliefs and ethical systems that are already in practice. Unfortunately, this also brings into being a situation that leaves the average American citizen with a fortuitously basic choice, conservative or liberal (example a:1). Notable critics of this process include Tocqueville, who stated that ""democracy breeds mediocrity"". This is not to say that democracy itself is undesirable, it does however point to the possibility that democracy coupled with capitalism authors an environment that is antithetical to itself. It takes government from the hands of the people, and delivers it into the hands of those whose sole interest is the profit of themselves and of those they are most closely affiliated with (i.e. the American Medical Association fighting legislation that would provide universal healthcare; big oil companies, lumber companies, chemical / pharmaceutical companies, and commercial restaurant chains fighting environs-mental legislation that would impose on the profitability of their business interests; the American Lawyers Association lobbying against tort reform, which would make the laws understandable to the average American, and lawsuit reduction acts.) These forces in mind, the American public is pitted against its national enemies, its political defectors, the media, big business, the Federal government, and itself. Opportunely, in a democracy people do have a voice, if they choose to use it. A voice not used is a voice stolen.]

Oh you know I love those bright lights when I step on stage to sing
I'll be travlin' round the country with a big bus and a band
So just keep the homefires burnin' while I'm gone
And I'll get home when I can
She said hon I hear your record oh they play it everyday
And everybody really likes it so I guess your on your way
But darling please remember we all need you here at home
And the kids all miss their daddy so don't be gone too long
Yes I know that your a country star and everybody knows your name
And I know you love those bright lights when you step on stage to sing
Just remember we all love you and don't get blinded by the light
We'll just keep the homefires burnin' while you're gone
You know we pray for you each night
After six long months of goin' I guess the road just finally took its toll
Cause his songs has lost all meaning and he felt so all alone
Then one night in Jackson he went out on stage to play
And the crowd stared at disbelief at the words he had to say
I don't want to be a country star it ain't the way I thought it'd be
Well it took me such a long time to know that it ain't the life for me
Cause the days can get so lonely and the nights can get so long
Lord I think it's about time this country star went home
Yes I think that it's about time this country boy went home"

In weary lust they have been sate o'er aisle
Seem to be screaming:
[Demons:]
Come we will
Stranger!
Stay for a while...
You will be our capture
why won't you be...
[Peter:]
So the dome is assailed by deviltry
[Demons:]
Virulence 'thro abominable sight
Come we will
Ye wait!
Tremendous ae!
[Peter:]
They frown upon earth and earth's centuries
Here the gargoyle's high above mighty kings
The beast has outdone 'em so she's got to wheeze
Lay wallow in cloudy skies
watch 'em if you please
I was sick and tired of blear and rainy day
so I did decide to have my rest that way
In spite of ostensible spat in my heart
I sat at the pulpit in hall breathing hard
[Demons as gargoyles:]
What would you say if we asked
you to remain here
until the time when days and nights are over
and then... come we will!
Did you not e'er happen to feel
as if you had lived somewhere formerly
and long ago?
And now you do discover
you're looking at something
you had seen long
long ago
[Peter:]
I've lost the track of time
Wild slumber swept away 'em all
Foamy fog is upon the woe-stained floor
pale gleam of silver chandeliers
obscure and delusive chants
have run over the choirs
so slow...
[Arthur:]
...Hence your virtuous mass
shall be almost like the sacred grove
where GOD himself does dwell and reign
among such saints which all you have become!
[Peter:]
The last one I heard
[Arthur:]
Sow the seed of the faith
deep into your hearts and lay open the gates
do lead towards the skies
there's the only device
that does promise place for you in paradise!
[Peter:]
I was falling asleep so I did close my eyes...
I was assailed by the spectre of beast
Lay waste all those charges 'cause I can't resist
I was obsessed by the shadow of noose
Take away your husk
I cannot refuse...
[Oze:]
Insidious grove!
And you shall have
your wooden scales for your very own!
[Peter:]
It seems to me I won't suffer this a-waiting for...
[Demons as gargoyles:]
As the darkness doth ravish the light wi' delight
sae deceit decimateth all the devoted minds
Chase the moribund rays of that desperate dawn
blood-red hues
that ye're hunting among for the crown
ye had ne'er had
and probably never ye will...
Ae hath ne'er been belonging to yer majesty!
But... ye believe that they will
reveal the unreal
the forces they hold
and the power they steal!
[Peter:]
Bemoan the lust of life with me!
Bewail their gloomy destiny!
[Oze:]
Just beware their bicker!
Of this ae...
I don't care!
[Caacrinolaas:]
Well
ye lay bar those wooden gates!
[Oze:]
Run outwards the reality!
Over the yawning deep...
[Both in chorus:]
Where as ye sow so shall ye reap!
[Peter:]
Each one received
swallowed and sipped
of that holy host'
""body"" and ""blood""
wafer and vine...
You'll do as divine
when yield shall arise
when you get Eucharist!
It seemed to me then...
They swallowed and sipped
instead of that holy host'
wafer and vine
only acorns and water...
like in sleepy nightmare!
All seemed to me then
""He seems to be dead!""
Lo! Whole vortex appears
drawing all wicked things
whining demons and imps
there is nothing to seize!
They reflowed forth again
beating their wings in vain snarling
no one is to blame
but it's true all the same!
This bout mire before me spread forth the abyss
so the heaven e'en seemed to be
on the verge of tears
Were I asked what I'd seen
through the veil of that mist
thick and grey one had covered swamps with its quilt
and the silence
dead one did howl so through my ears
that I hardly could hear
I should probably say
Almost nothing I felt through that torture but pain
but that ominous emptiness did whirl me away...
As it seemed to me then
far away from my corpse!
So that night swam before me
it turned out to be
one in which the moon barely shone over the sea
of that desolate gloom 'n hardly anything was
seen but blue marsh lights were skipping about in the swamps
And quagmire before me spread forth the abyss...
O'er that dark one a rather small stump
met my sight
sticking out from the earth
remnant of rotten trunk
of a tree that had grown o'er that deep long ago
and roots spreading throughout this one
like mighty snakes
twisted roots reaching downwards into that bog
as if there to quench
their blind and desperate thirst...
Met my sight deep
and roots simply hanging in the air
[Arthur:]
Behold his holy holt anon...
[Peter:]
But I shall be dead long before
everything will have become clear to me...
I have never heard such improper song
e'en though incredible call it ye will!
[Demons as gargoyles:]
Call us inscrutable!
Then all the things of that sort shall cease!
Call 'em incredible wood or stone...
and bog if you please!
Which guise do you prefer?
Whose scales do you mean to be the chosen one?
[Caacrinolaas:]
You had better petrify!

Cancerous poisoning anchored by this weakest link
Turn your lying face in utter shame

Dead as the void that you've left here in me
Deeper and deeper spent memories
Cremating all that would bear your disease
An end is what you wanted
The end is what you'll receive
Onward into battle forever we soldier
Unflinchingly undying and free
Forced to cut you down just another enemy stripped of immortality
Cancerous poisoning how the smallest violin does sing
As the obituaries cries out your cursed name
Now as the towers fall crumbling at our feet
Lay down your sword you must answer to me
Leper, banished to be
We punish your treason unmercifully
Liar, ears deaf to your pleas
There'll be no remorse, no sympathy, bleed
That very blade which lead you to battle in defense of our name
Shall cut a red ring 'round your throat
Too little too late, the flood waters break
While you've dared to call down the most savage of storms
Violent reprisal written in blood
To so cruelly be made an example of
To so cruelly be made an example of
This is war, revenge has been sworn

It was there with our solders during war time,
And right today we still hear it now and then.

Who's record were just starting to be heard
That old tune took him right up to stardom
on the wings of the great speckled bird.
Hank Thomson is a country music legend
He sang western swing and songs of grief and strife
That same tune gave Hank the break he needed
On a record called the wild side of life.

Kitty Wells was that young singers name
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels

Seems to beat a fatalistic warning

I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days

Most of us were staying in, lazy like the sky.
The letters flew across the wire filtered through a million liars.
The whole world smelled like burning tires the day John Henry died.
We knew about that big machine that ran on human hope and steam.
Bets on John were far between and mostly on the side.
We heard he put up quite a fight. His hands and feet turned snowy white.
That hammer rang out through the night the day John Henry died.
When John Henry was a little bitty baby nobody ever taught him how to read
But he knew the perfect way to hold a hammer was the way the railroad baron held the deed.
It didn't matter if he won, if he lived, or if he'd run.
They changed the way his job was done. Labor costs were high.
That new machine was cheap as hell and only John would work as well,
So they left him laying where he fell the day John Henry died.
John Henry was a steel-driving bastard but John Henry was a bastard just the same.
An engine never thinks about his daddy and an engine never needs to write its name.
So pack your bags, we're headed west and L.A. ain't no place to rest.

For the fragile beauty of our lives must fade

So in January we're gettin' married

Down so low I barely hear her
But I know what she's sayin'
I understand because my heart and hers are the same
And in January we're gettin' married
And I was sick with heartache
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn when I met her
But we would both surrender
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down
Don't ever turn it down
I hope that I don't sound to insane when I say
There is darkness all around us
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes for her to protect me
And reconnect me to the beauty that I'm missin'
And in January we're gettin' married
No longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in
She knows which birds are singin'
And the names of the trees where they're performin' in the mornin

From out of the city and out of the street
Out where the wind hits the cold concrete
It's cold outside
Darkness your enemy
No place to hide
The voice said this to me
In your doorways I have shivered
In your alleys I have gone to ground
But I will be delivered
Someday I will be mercy bound
I dreamed again it was West LA
On a crowded street on a hot summer day
She was alone
Three months late and beginning to show
In a midriff blouse she would soon outgrow
She had no one to call and no way home
And in my mind I knew I'd seen myself
But in our blindness it always seems like someone else
There I was a rag a bone
A remnant in your lost and found
I was for once truly alone
Longing to be mercy bound
And I knew that I would wander
As a child in the forest till they found me
And I called out to them but could not penetrate
The silence all around me
And when I wake I know you'll comfort me
And I won't sleep again for an eternity
But others lie awake at night
In desperation more profound
And the coming of the morning light
Will not see them mercy bound
And some will never dream again
From sleeping on the ground
Longing to belong
And dying to be mercy bound
Oh please don't stop your dreaming
Someday we'll all be mercy bound"

This means I have no fate

A life to know

Someone to follow
Until my life shuts down
And darkness fills my veins

If I'm alive

O.J. Simpson

Hall of Famer Rod Carew. [He converted]
We got Ann Landers,
And her sister Dear Abby,
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish
Not too shabby
Some people think
That Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well, he's not, but guess who is --
All three Stooges!
So many Jews are in show biz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is!
Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Hannukah

Soltarte a la cara la verdad
Y dar media vuelta
Recoger mi chaqueta
Y salir por la puerta contigo

Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

That September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white, and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you

Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Teachin' a class full of innocent children
Or drivin' down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on I Love Lucy reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man

Nothing within worthwhile to revive

Gorging our gnawing jaws with our own pathological waste
Like grubs wriggling in the rank feast of decay
We grind our own bones into dust each futile step we take

Upon the fetid mass we choke
Leaving us in no position to appreciate the sick joke
Twisted through this mortal coil
Now our unctuous desserts are brought to a boil
Somewhere between the living and the deceased
We gag on the feast of our grotesqueries
Too consumed by consumption to see our own ends
We're all dead and only getting deader
Digging our own graves into which we gladly descend
In this cold coil we're shackled and fettered
As we ingest each others' waste, in a frenzied feeding rush
Leaving everything sick and dead in our wake
Devouring each other in ravening, unheeding crush
As we gorge ourselves on all the tripe and offal we can intake
Crass menagerie

Down to the root of my desire

Am I a fool for hanging long?
Would I be a fool for being long gone?
When is daylight gonna dawn
On my crazy faith?

Let the hope fly from the glove
Do not search the skies above
Search your crazy faith
Love is lightning, love is ice
It only strikes the lucky twice
Once or you will know the price
And once for crazy faith

In the pearls of our heart
There is the immaculate heavenly loveland
In the middle of the forest Actæon is slain by his own hounds
In the middle of the forest Eustace meets the crisscross Stag
There is the land he has reached paradise
There is no death
There is no death
There as the stag turns and smiled loved

The one you have intercourse with hosts a virus
Infections blood tainted with HIV
Passing the contagion on to you
You are now a member of the modern epidemic

A virus destroying all of your antibodies
You are now so susceptible
A blood test of positive now revealed
Covered with skin eating fesions
AIOS hungrily grows at your immune system
Your T-cell lymphocytes destroyed
Fatal condition kills slowly
Too weak to move, breathe, or ever get aroused
Running ulcers and abscesses wrap your body
Quarantined to your death bed, you stick to your sheets
The disease has developed to a most sever state
Ashes to ashes, genitals to jelly
Your personal gender soon to fall oil
An erotic flower decayed at the roots
Latex could have kept your sex life intact
Now never again to be hard to wet
Discharge and drip genitourinary loakage
Reproductive organs butchered and raw
The risk for gratification is your epitaph
Ignorance is bliss and eventually death
You never gave much thought about tomorrow
But now as you struggle to try and breathe
Yesterday is always on your mind now
And what ever happened to you lethal lay?
Death through sexual transmission
You make love to the grim reaper
This day and age sex kills
Unknowingly lusting after your demise
Desire plummeting into the venereal depths
A coital union with cankerous effects
Toxic passions, the rapture kills slowly

Melting in syphagonnaherpeaids

Careless promiscuity
Skin is in
Diseased disguised behind a beautiful face
Your terminal venture too late

Your body cannot summon enough protection
Against this ever growing infection
Ravaged by AIDS abominable symptoms and effects
Death claims you through virtual sex
An incurable doom from lethal lovemaking
Such suffering and sickness from a moment of ecstasy

Your lamed mate is begging another victim
Death through sexual transmission

Why had he waited for so long
To flee his home forever shaded, where the jaded are never wrong?
He took a deep breath
He was finally gone
His hope was left strong
That a meaning would be found
That had kept him withdrawn
His stare had caught a light

And you will wake up
Without the feeling that half the world
Has gone insane
You'll open your eyes
Reading your paper, a drink from your cup
No one was burning down the town
While you were sleeping
I've never seen but I believe
In a promised land

One and all, now and forever
Why can't we pull this together
We can say we finally found a world around us

Think of a place
Where you could believe in whatever you want
Not keep it secret
Have to risk your life just to be yourself
A place where you'll walk safely
No matter your color or age
More than the greed of you and me
Decides the fate of the day

What she needs or how to let go

She says
""Bye bye my childhood dream man
I will keep in touch if I can
Spent the best years of my life with you""
Happens every time
You start to lose yourself
You turn to blame the one
That loves you the most
To stay and work it out is harder
Than to run away
So she leaves a note
Because to his face she couldn't say
""Bye bye my childhood dream man
I will keep in touch if I can

Hold on if you can
Hold on
So all things fade in time
But what was once so bright
Somehow no longer shines
Caught the pain at last
Thought he was the one
Thought she had the strength to hold
""Bye bye my child hood dream man

Here I'm pinned between darkness and light
Bleached and blinded by these nights
Where I'm tossing and tortured 'til dawn
By you, visions of you then you're gone

When I hear someone's taken my place
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel?
When all, all that I did was for you

But I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom

And I'd come home with mud on my feet

And Mom, we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes

And she knew that her darling had died

She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight

Up the trees beside the road
The grass is getting greener
So we must be getting close
There he stands a-waiting
As the train pulls to the gate
There's so many things to ask him
But they're gonna have to wait
With cap in hand he stands there
Every hair is combed in place
His shiny boots reflecting
The big smile on his face

You've helped me
Find myself to love a man

To his buckboard by the tree
Hand in hand we ride
To the house he built for me
He picks me up and gently
Carries me through the cabin door

A new moon Candy can love,
And they were out of the strange park,
So I got a brave monster truck,
Flung the case down with beer,
We'll be back next year,

I am anything but anybody's foundling

A bubble in a baby's dream, a lost and lonely buzzardling
A vulture beating creaky wings, while angry storms go gathering around me

When the clouds are howlin rain and the sky is black as ashes
'Cause it's sunlight where we flew, though the trail is cold above
And the raven quakes in vain while the lightning barks and flashes
Still the clouds will fade to gray cocoons
And spring the winken monarchs, nodding never-blinken moons

They can live with murder on death row but not Roe vs. Wade
So I promised them if they got me elected some changes would be made
So now those irresponsible teenagers will be forced to have a kid
It makes no difference to me I don't sleep around like Clinton did
Are we now to regress back to the Reagan years, the ruling elite's wet dream?
Where capital punishment is viewed as civilized but art and music as obscene
Claiming that they're for less government rule in livelihood as they set the stage
To tip the scales in the companies favor, freeze the minimum wage
Fight to reinstate prayer in public schools and make the christians proud
Appoint Supreme Court justices who will insure that abortion is disallowed
Cutting all of the medical coverage for those inflicted with A.I.D.S.
And push the gays back in the closet in hopes that their movement fades
I can't relate to homosexuals so I'll keep same sex marriages banned

He's a veteran of the trenches so I put him on my team
Because it's time to bring back all the tactics of the Reagan-Bush regime
With Jeb's help I stole the election and brought the liberal era to an end
And although the left-wing will not like it I'm going to set things right again
They initiate absurdity that to them makes perfect sense
Cut out every social program and simultaneously build up our defense
That they'll mostly use for internal conflict, like when the activists 'attack'
And the provoked protectors of the law have no choice but to fight back
When assessing what the problem is their lack of judgment never fails
And the only answer that they have is to build more jails
Every time the standard of living drops and a rise in crime ensues
They never attribute it to survival but a lack of family values
I'm here to restore dignity to the Whitehouse once again
And I can't do that in reality so I'll guess I'll just pretend
It's no big shock that I'll starve the poor and cater to those with wealth
In fact the only thing that may surprise you is that I manage to dress myself

And He's holding out a saving hand for me.
He'll be a refuge in the storm;

In the chilly winds of doubt He'll keep you warm;
When you can't find your way He'll be your light"

The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, 'This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done, shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all.'
'The torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck'
He said, 'I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks.'
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, 'Ain't you that songwriter guy?'
I said, 'Yes, I am,' he said, 'So am I.'
And he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
And he said, 'What do you think? Now don't hold nothin' back.'
Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look
And I said, 'This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs have backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak.'
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, 'Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news.
But your whole melodic structure's done worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you.'
And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks.'
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long
You guessed it
It may be a hit

No one can follow us.
We were gone before we came, alone, eternal
Dark and damned

No consolation
And when we reach what we came for
It won't be a victory,
it's just the beginning of another end

You have given back hell to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism
as long as you sit calm and small
You'll never feel the chains
And then we'll create ourselves a god
Without whom we cannot live.
At night like a big black beast

Sing out the pain of your roots that you cannot deny

I will feel bliss when your mortal soul is in ruins
I will grin in the shadows

And who knows it might last for life

Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,

Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling

I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
I wanna good steed under me like my forefathers before
Courageous at first we took their worst, our positions we held stout
We clung to belief and we hung on the speech from our trusted leaders mouths
Overwhelming odds and a hopeless cause and our cities overrun
There were them that said we was badly led and God were we outgunned
I lost count of the worthy mounts that from under me were cut
My favourite mare with her head in the air took the cannons in her gut
In the first two weeks on that bloody creek my brother lost his arm
Was only sixty days till all we prayed was get us home unharmed
O for the day that we signed our names and the well that we were wished
The mens congrats and the pats on the backs and the ladies that we kissed
The band that played and the grande parade and the patriotic shouts
All faded fast, didn't even last till the uniforms wore out
And there were none to replace nor to help us face the winters cold and bleak
That chilled to the bone the pneumonia prone and froze our bootless feet
Then the typhoid hit with its fevered fits, TB and dysentery
That proved in the end to have killed more men than the vilest enemy
We were finally forced to feed on horse and carcass we could scrounge
When the wagons stopped and wed burnt their crops to charred and barren ground
With morale in doubt and our pride run out no honour did I see
All I seen were a thousand dreams piled dead in front of me
I wanna be in the cavalry if the send me off to war
I wanna be in the cavalry but I wont ride home no more"

Walked the cold streets of New York with two guitars and a tin cup just for dimes

Had some trouble once in Fargo some bad times in Enceno but we had fun
We made the papers once in Phoenix when we stopped and tried to break up a fight
We hit keno in Reno and lost it all in Vegas the very next night
We hopped a train in Chicago and skinny dipped in San Francisco bay
We checked it all in the big hotels then used the fire escape to get away
And we wouldn't trade it all for the world and all of its gold
It's the past that makes the future worth livin'
Mother Luck's been good to us and we will praise her in our songs
For the good times and the good love she has given

But so are they
But they don't know me

So much for my happy ending
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done
You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending

Bloodloss... And my mind's confused
Torn between decisions
Made between incisions

I draw the shortest straw
But suddenly I came to clarity
About the black beast inside of me
Contorted through submission
It took life to a higher position
I've felt the black light
Shining with strongest might
Guiding to the homicidal paths
And to unleash ungodly wrath
I've seen the black light
Blinding with strongest might
Showing me the homicidal way
As I slowly become its slave
..The price all must pay
There must be no mercy for the
insignificant and weak
It's no tragedy that all this misery must
be cleansed through me

You'll draw the shortest straw

Death is triumphant and wears its crown

Translation
[from larry keith ogle]
On the green stubble-fields of autumn
I saw you, my sweetheart.
Nice were your feet in shoes
And wonderful your nimble gait.
Your hair the color of roses
And your ringlets tightly plaited
Alas that we're not married
Or on board ship sailing away
The boys around here are
Laughing and getting bold
And the people of the high straw?
Are making ? ? of my brown girl
If the king of spain would
Go abroad with his assembled men
I would flatten grass and rank grass
And I would be with my brown girl
Buying cows at the fair
If I were ? and my brown girl
Go and come first love
Until we go over to gaoth-bearra
Until we separate from each other
The tops of the branches and the swan
From the waves ?
That won't separate us
And it's only folly for you to put it ? ?
I wrote a letter
To my sweetheart and a sharp complaint
She sent it back to me
That her heart was inside me.
Compose the artsswannoble person ?
Finer than silk or bird feathers
Heavy is my sigh
When I think of being apart from her.
What I heard on Sunday
As conversation among the women
That she was going to be married
To a young man from the place.
Sweetheart take my advice
And this autumn stay as you are
And don't tell anyone, my love,
That you are my love."

Telling the story of a ghost but I chose you
I could have been a wizard with a big book of spells
I could have been a diva or a farmer in the dell
I could have had a luxury car
Or been a maid working at a bar but I chose you
I could have been a doctor to ease your belly ache
I could have been a lady of the night hiding from the daybreak
I could have been a Mademoiselle
Or a little girl at show and tell but I chose you

I was working towards you, shining light
If I fall for you before I wake
Then bless your soul this love I?ll take it"

1)
They let Bubba out of prison
He paid for his crime
He didn't know them bad cheques
Could give him so much time
Sister's getting married
There's a shotgun on the groom
Hope they finish the wedding vows
Before the baby's due
2)
Harry's in the closet
He's been there all his life
Everybody wonders
Why he never took a wife
We owe a lot of bills
Trying to live beyond our means
Ain't got a pot,
But we got cable TV,
CHORUS
======
But it's our family
Full of skeletons and ghosts
And even with our strange relatives
It's the one we love the most
There may be a bunch of nuts
Up our family tree
Yeah we may all be crazy
But it's still our family
3)
Grandpa's got a girlfriend
A woman half his age
Grandma laughs about it
But I sense the silent rage
And Uncle Burt still thinks
He's on the grand old armoury
That fever from the war
Left him living in a dream
4)
We buried Great Ann-Martha
Out the forest lawns today
Now I think I know why
They Called Great Ann-Martha great
The church was full of strange men
Mama called it a disgrace
She said they should have wiped that
Smile off Great Ann-Marthas face
Chorus

But it's our family
Full of skeletons and ghosts
And even with our strange relatives
It's the one we love the most

Or is it still newly wed?
If all this heat is doing is making us stick to the bed
Then there is no life to revive.
But if the hunger is still there, hidden somewhere inside
Covered up by the boredom we've been trying to hide
Then dig it up and devour
And it will be more like a song
And less like its math
If you pull on my hair, and bite me like that
And the truth is that I can't hardly wait
And I don't care if we stay up too late
Don't answer the phone
Don't answer the phone
And it will be more like a song and less like its math
If you pull on my hair and bite me like that
And the truth is that I can't hardly wait
It itches so bad that I can't concentrate
Don't answer the phone

that I won't break my honor before all.
A one-way mission through life, I won't change my course.
There's far too much to experience and accomplish to waste a precious
second drunk or hazed. An effective revolutionairy through
the clarity of mind that I've attained. I see it all for what it
is as Gommorah's Season Ends in the grave.
So many have become demoralized that now a change must be forced
or all will perish in the lunacy once it befalls.
Parasites gnaw at the basis, their vulgar ways bring pointless ends.
Perpetuating the degeneration.
In this self is all I need with this oath that keeps me free.
To this I am forever true. I am straight edge.
I am straight edge. I am straight edge. I am straight edge."

Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
No Mother or Dad not a friend could I see,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,

To a beautiful home by the bright Crystal Sea,
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in Heaven,
Where no one will be a stranger to me.

Was when I looked up just in time to see that young cowboy goin' flyin',
And land in a pile at my feet.
And as the first aid came to haul him away, I said son you'll be
Allright in a little while.

But someone came along and helped me like I'm helping you
And if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune kept you down this time
But there's usually a reason for it all
You'll run into things that hurt you all the time
And the higher up the harder that you fall
First thing you have to do is be sure you wanna fly
Cause no one in the world can do it for you
Then practice what you learn by doin' all that you can do
Cause if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune...
So go spread your little bluebird wings and fly away
May the melodies of love always be with you
And someday you'll help someone remember what I'm telling you

Aiming a throats bare.The moment is so near
The time seems to halt for a while

You watched me hunt for tips I was obliged to pick up
From the passing trade

Hey, kids--look at this

I could get back up if you insist
But you'll have to ask politely
'Cause the eggshells I've been treading
Couldn't spare me a beheading
And I'll know I had it coming
From a Caesar who was only slumming
Hey, kids--look at this
It's the fall of the world's own optimist
Well, I could have objections
Which you could override
But what's the point--we're only flogging the horse
When the horseman has up and died
Once I testified
And swore I'd never leave a stone unturned--
I bet you're really glad that I lied

Secluded, where my head is quick but my heart is slow

So all that we know that is broken falls back together

And every false belief that you think is true was put inside of you

Everyone you know is fighting a battle of their own
Now do unto yourself what your neighbors never show
What a world we live in we're falling for everything and anyone but us
You just want somebody to love the hell out of you
But you will never find that kind of love in someone before yourself
We all want to be found and held so close

In that wee dark engine room,
Where the chill seeps through your soul,
How we huddled round that wee pot stove
That burned oily rags and coal.
C F C G7 G /
How the winter blizzards blow, and the whaling fleet's at rest,
Tucked in Leigh harbor's sheltered bay, safely anchored ten abreast.
The whalers at their stations, as from she'd to she'd they go,
Carry little bags of coal with them, and a little iron stove.
CHORUS
The fireman Paddy worked with me on the engine stiff and cold.
A stranger to the truth was he - there's not a lie he hasn't told.
And he boasted of his gold mine, and of all the hearts he'd won,
And his bonny sense of humor shone just like a ray of sun.
CHORUS
Then one day we saw the sun and factory ships' return.
Meet your old friends, sing a song; hope the season won't be long,
Then homeward bound when it's over; we'll leave this icy hold,
But I always will remember that little iron stove.

""Many songs are sung about whaling and whalers. Almost all describe
A voyage, or the catch of the whale, or some of the men and their
Needs. This song, written by Eric Bogle, describes the bone-
Chilling existance of the men who stayed with the ships when they
Were laid up for the winter, doing routine maintenance and engine
Overhaul in the clammy, unheated holds of the engine rooms."" -ET

Why are you always in control?
We used to hide all your stuff away
when I come round wanting to play
you're never open in any way
why have you got nothing to say

before you learnt to use your gun
you make me worry 'till I feel sick
I have to run so far away"

Shaking my memories

As I whisper my last words
Seem to fade away

The train is moving forward and closer
Can't stand up and walk away
Once I made my mind up so long ago
Now I can't change
It is just too bad
I feel so left alone, so forgotten
Nobody knows where I am, no one misses me
Cold water runs from my eyes
And the cold is freezing my last tears
Like I'm only half in my body, I can't feel
I think I'm already half gone, I can't think
It's getting colder and colder and colder
I can't breathe

Cold cold metal - freezing
Cold cold metal - my head will burst open
Cold cold metal - it's been too much"

There's some cotton thread and needles for the folks in way-out-yonder
A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander
Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills

There's a letter full of sadness trimmed with black around the border
A pair of boots for someone who had them made to order
A bible in the pack for the Reverend Mr. Black

The moment I met you, I swear.
I felt as if something, somewhere,
Had happened to me, which I couldn't see.
And then, the moment I met you, again.
I knew in my heart that we were friends.
It had to be so, it couldn't be no.
But try as hard as I might do, I don't know why.
You get to me in a way I can't describe.
Words mean so little when you look up and smile.
I don't care what people say, to me you're more than a child.
Oh Clair. Clair
Clair
If ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare.
That moment is you in all that you do.
But why in spite of our age difference do I cry.
Each time I leave you I feel I could die.
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say,
""I'm going to marry you. Will you marry me? Oh hurray!""
Oh Clair Clair
Clair
I've told you before ""Don't you dare!""
""Get back into bed.""
""Can't you see that it's late.""
""No you can't have a drink.""
""Oh allright then, but wait just a minute.""
While I, in an effort to babysit, catch up on my breath,
What there is left of it.
You can be murder at this hour of the day.
But in the morning the sun will see my lifetime away.

Cutting hair in the modern style, putting in the nine to five,
But every night it was the same old dream,
On the cover of a magazine,
She looked good, but it could never come true,
'Cause nothing ever happens round here,
Nothing ever happens round here;
She had a boyfriend in the town, he spent his days just messing around,
With stick shifts and steering wheels, motorbikes and automobiles,
And every night it was the same old thing,
Meet the boys for a couple of drinks,
Shoot pool and talk about girls,
And nothing ever happens round here,
Nothing ever happens round here;
They said nothing, no nothing, no nothing, nothing ever happens round here,
Nothing, no nothing, no nothing, nothing ever happens round here;
One day in a local bar, she heard a movie man was looking for a star,
And everybody in the whole damn town, got the call to come on down,
And when she walked into the room,
Every heart went boom-boom-boom - who's that girl?
She's exactly what we're looking for,
But nothing ever happens round here,
Nothing ever happens round here;
They said nothing, no nothing, no nothing, nothing ever happens round here,
Nothing, no nothing, no nothing, nothing ever happens round here;
And so she took a screen test, no doubt that she was the best,
The camera fell in love with her,
Before she knew it she was on the way to make that dream come true;
Now she's living in Hollywood, and everything is looking good,
She thinks about the folks back home, and her boyfriend all alone,
But every night it's still the same old thing,
Meet the boys for a couple of drinks,
Shoot pool and talk about girls,
And nothing ever happens round here,
Nothing ever happens round here;

(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

You took me higher and higher and higher
I never thought it would end
Then I woke up to find you'd left me behind
Now what am I supposed to do
Tell me how do I get off the moon
[Chorus]
Tell me how do I get these stars from my eyes
And how do I get on with my life
How do I hold someone new when I can't let go of you
Tell me how do I get off the moon
I never planned on leaving
Guess you never planned to stay
And after we'd come so far together
How you'd just walk away and leave me up here
In this cold atmosphere lost without a clue
Tell me how do I get off the moon

our clothes are hung to dry
we're visiting the selling's
on the shore of the puget sound
the scenery gets a hold of you like a bad record
there's something not as valid when the scenery's a postcard
and the view from the glass is just the glass upon the finish
and the conversations people have about the lush surroundings
are all tainted by the cards they got from travelling companions
olympia is shorter to the street than what i thought
the view from in the city
isn't scenery at all
but it gets a hold of you like a bad record"

Where sorrow pulls the skyline of reality
And restarts a love ever after
As we grasp beyond defeat

For just one moment with one another with one another
This night is falling on my hearts shame
These feelings bring tears to my eyes
Just take away my world,
Leave my side
Hear the angels sing,
As I embrace you with a warm welcome home
With a warm welcome home
Hear the angels sing

Tomorrow, the air will be a little colder
But I'll be sure to breathe for the both of us.
And the nights
May be a little darker
But I'll be sure to carry the torch to warm the hearts
They're never gonna have to feel yours
I can hear your voice,
I can't hear your voice
But that's okay
'Cause I can feel you in my heart
I can hear your voice,
I can't hear your voice
But that's okay
'Cause I can feel you in my heart
One morning I'll wake up to you,
One morning I'll hear the angels sing.
On that morning we won't be worried about the weather
Nor will we might wither his life
While the clocks alarm.
I'll be sure to write your name in the sun
Where the waves can't wash it away
I'll be sure to write your name in the sun
Where the waves can't wash it away
Until then I'll walk,
Until then I'll breathe in your name!
Never surrender the dream you had for this world to love, to forgive
To make something out of nothing!
I will feel you, I will hear you forever!"

Do not jump sir please whatever you do please do not jump.
Yea hi look uh, there's a guy and he's on a building, uh and he looks like he's gonna jump.
Yea I uh I'm on the... I am on uh, fuck, do you know where we are? JUMP!
Why the hell are you telling him to jump? JUMP! DON'T JUMP!
[Violent J:]
I don't get this
Fuck sickness and livin with this
Never get to forget this
Not even on Christmas
No way to dismiss this
What the fuck is this
They tell me it's all in my head why can't I get a witness
Fuck it I was never meant to be and now my own hater
Up the elevator
On the rooftop seconds later
Lookin over the ledge about to plunge
Take a deep breath in my lungs
Here the street comes
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
This is it, my last step, my last crawl
My last attempt to reach out and touch the one to call
My phone's been cut off and bills are pilin up so high
I'm on this ledge and fully prepared to die
Police lights litterin streets beneath my feet
Fifty stories below I can here them hollering, ""Freeze
It's all okay, just give it another day.""
They turn to screams as I step off and drift away
[Chorus:]
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast

I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
[Monoxide Child:]
You think I'm doin this shit for fun
The second time in a week, but the first was just a practice run
Don't need a gun to end all of my suffering
All I need to do is jump, get these evil voices outta me
You don't love the fact that every night
You hear whispers convincing you to end it all by daylight
I'm about to take flight and shut em all up
Just thought I'd let you know the real reason that Paul jumped
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
I'm lookin over this ledge at these matchbox cars
Fifty-seven levels up and ya hit that concrete hard
Why my meds don't work no more
Why my doc quit on me
I rung his neck, his eyes popped, he don't wanna see me obviously
Now I'm waitin for my balls to grind this concrete and crumble
A gang of mother fuckers sayin, ""Don't do it you won't see no trouble""
Next thing I know I heard loud screams holy fuck
The ground's comin my way mighty fast cause I just jumped
[Chorus:]
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin

[Jamie Madrox:]
My fingers scratch into the building as I pull up and climb
Feel like I'm a spider inside of my mind
Passin windows up with every story up I go
Takin a look inside, people sittin in cubicles
While I'm out here losin it, scalin the bricks
The higher up that I crawl the more that I'm feelin sick
Once I get to the top I can let it all go
As I fall through the air to the sidewalk below

As my sword drips black now with the unclean blood of another slain fiend, it
occurs to me that history will most probably record me a fanatic... as for
more years than I care to remember I have dedicated my life to the caseless
pursuit and destruction of the loathsome undead. Indeed, it was long ago that
I commenced with the wreaking of my grim vengeance upon the denizens of the
dark, and by the blade of my sorcerous katana, Fiend's Bane, I vow they shall
all pay for taking my beloved from me! Fanatic? Mayhap. But by all the gods of
vengeance, I'll leave a fearsome legacy 'ere I die... a legacy wrought in
retributive bloodshed and screaming terror!
Drowned in the icy lake of tragedy,
Forged in the fires of revenge,
Driven by the winds which compel a man to destiny,
Haunted by the whispers of the dead.
Blood is black in the moonlight
As it was when I pierced the heart of my betrothed,
Blood is black in the moonlight,
Her undead gaze gleaming ire upon me.
Blood is black in the moonlight
I held aloft her head to my grim gods,
Blood is black in the moonlight
(Now I am eternally bonded to my blade)
And ever I am thwarted by the dark!
Gods of wrath, hear my vow... sate me with revenge this night!
Come to me, darksome fiends, taste the edge of ensorcelled steel!
Night has fallen, the hunt begins...
Vengeful carnage 'neath the moon!
And as I put brand to her pyre, I swore then to my gods that those vile
creatures who tore the life and hope from my beloved's breast and replaced it
with that unspeakable sanguineous ravening would repay a hundredfold in
slaughter and bloodshed for their misdeed... I would hunt them to their
worm-ridden tombs, wherever they crept or slithered upon the earth, and wreak
my honed steel revenge ceaselessly unto my own grave. Such was my vow!
Aye, this bride of Masayuki steel, ensorcelled by wizards at its forging... to
me she is as pure as the newly fallen snow, kissed by the breeze at dusk...
and yet she has supped deep of the ichors of many men and fiends alike.
Shadow spawned demons ravening for my blood,
Yet the thirst of my blade is greater!
Aye, all they shall feast upon this night will be cold steel!
I hear the slither of scales on silk,
Fiend's Bane replete with undead slaughter!
I am the scourge of the devils who dwell in darkness...
(but the darkness writhing in my own soul is so much deeper...)
Their flesh burns at the touch of my blade of searing vengeance,
And I cast their malign spirits screaming into limbo!

But, love remains the same
Find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space

I walk the streets through seven bars
I have to find just where you are

So much to be done
Don't you trick me now
We shall overcome
So all that's left is praying
But we, should have had the sun
We could have been inside
Instead we're over here

When England to blame,
And so I'm a part of the patriot game.
It's barely two years since I wondered away,
With the local battalion of the bold I-R-A,
I've read of our heroes and I've wanted the same,
To play out my part in the patriot game.

Six counties are under John Bull's tyranny,
So I gave up my boyhood to drill and to train,
To play my own part in the patriot game."

Bediademed, souled
With a murder of ravens
But no less Astarte to behold
Abandoned by Heaven
To the dead, dark and past
Cast her dispersions
On life's brittle glass
And though her eyes still held fire
As stonewalls caged the beast
'Gainst the lassitudes of Death
She fought but fell to greet
And midst lies in collusion
She was martyred to teach
That Divinity and Lust
Are forever forbidden to meet
But I swore that they would
Before the veil could part our embrace
Twixt her cold, silent hips, I kissed
And promised Christendom in flames
Gravid with madness
Like a feculent dirge
That obsesses the heart

To avenge her Ebon splendor and surrender
My soul to the dead to achieve
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
Horripilation braying over carious herds
Vexing nightmares
And their weak prayers
To a no one there
To hinder her decree
To weed the world of their disease
As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
The meat that is their congregation
How they plead to the skies
But this is mere foreplay to war
Scar-riddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
Now his skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
For her interred
I tore a battle banner from his hide
Splashed in red goetia
Hues of Hell and deicide
So came the night
Its obsidian light
Is a master whom disasters
Suck upon like concubines
And under black skirts
That whisper of delight
Dark seeds near fruition
Darked deeds to marry mine
In Death's bed, I have lain
Paying lip-service to shame
But for dreaming of thee, I regain
A reason to seek life again
Then we smite the divine
For our true nature is sin
To strip tender flesh from these swine
Like the lick of carnivorous winds
The breath of the storm that begins
By forcing its Herod tongue in
The womb of the Holy Virgin
To taste of immaculate sin
From temptation's peak, we will see
The world unfurled at last
Now the wolves of time who stalk mankind
Shall be as one in grim repast
Commemorating sickle moons
The pack are poised to reap
A scythe of white roses in bloom
Whose twisted thorns will keep
A crown upon a dead man
Daylights crucified in sleep
And lives that hide in scriptured lies
To the memories of a scream
And we shall dance amid the ruin
As Adam and Evil
Dizzy at the falling stars
That burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
If all must we damn for this moment
Then it shall be so
For our souls have crossed oceans of time
To clasp one another more tightly
Than Death could alone
As Zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
The talons of lust rake a clarion call
To the lick of carnivorous winds

But I hae parted frae my Love,
Never to meet again, my dear,

Thorn Of My Omnipotence
(Music by Bartsch/Matton/Landfermann December 1995)
(Poems by Bartsch December 1995)
Christ, thou pale queen of the clotted bloodrain
Suffocate in the omnipotence of my death-bringing
heritage
that, shaped like a scythe,
will be the last hand to the resurrection
Buried in the noble evaporation of greed and penance
My horror of the third cross yields
to the sweet temptation of an unpure tasting
little grave
Blood
Oh thou, my unpure flesh
turn yellow in the present
kill the tomorrow
promise of the last dwelling
brought to the grave
forgive my nakedness
Blood
Hypocrite in me
born of decay
of anarchy
of dead flesh
Deliverance
forgive me my shrine
forgive me my soul
Blackness
The forbidden lines
and always only death
the unquenched thirst
the copper scent
the bursting inferno
yet where will I be
will be the virginity
will be the faith
of the writhing flame
of my bestial blasphemy
Blood
thou blackened hope
of my final judgement
the dying me
secured in a bloodstained cloth
secured in very eternal peace
Lost
eternally lost
stride into your death
For know,
where darkness reigns,
I am."

Nothin's gonna slow me down till I reach that sacred ground,
Won't be too long now.
I know I'm gonna find a place,
To rest this weary soul,
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.
Instrumental break.
Someday I'll lay down those memories.
Feel, the sun on my face and the freedom under my feet.

Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.

But I could never let it be that way
Mama's life line proved a good noose
With a taste for killing, I was on the loose
My folks hated me for what I did that day
So I slit their throats, sent 'em to their grave
I headed for the Smokie's in Tennessee
Yeah, lot of good killing was ahead of me
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
Met a mountain girl from a mining town
Our first time when the sun went down
All she wanted was to marry me
So I cut her where she loved me
And watched her bleed
Her daddy from the holler saw her blood so red
So I drug him in the river and I drowned him dead
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
Wore out my welcome in Arkansas
Killed a Christian family of the Pentecost
Georgia Cracker was a talking at me
So I cut out his tongue, hung from a tree
Now the southern law wants to put me in jail
But I'll still be killing when I'm burning in hell

It flashed and erupted, the gods crippled with laughter
And i was powerless to pretend that i wasn't in control
Of all the cities that glittered this was the city that glowed
How could you choose water over wine?
When there's so much to spare
Save your breath tonight's not done with you yet
You can't understand the depths until all you know becomes unknown
Who are we if not the walls that surround us?
Nothing is ever safe, nothing is ever clear
Who are we if not the skin that binds to our bones?
Nothing is ever safe, nothing is ever clear
Cue the sun, the siege has passed, the tide has spoken and his words fall fast
Will I ever learn before I wash ashore
Or is this a scar that I've grown to adore
Who are we if not the walls that surround us?
Nothing is ever safe, nothing is ever clear
Who are we if not the skin that binds to our bones?
Nothing is ever safe, nothing is ever clear
You can't resent the road that gave you something to lose
We're just the sum of the paths that we came through
So hold your breath like it's everything you have
Let it divulge and digest cause it's running out too fast
It's like floating on an open door or watching waves from underwater
So let's pretend that we, let's pretend that we understand the depths
Of what's buried in our chests
What we've evolved to hide behind the sternum or is it pride?
It's a power you can't ignore, spend a lifetime searching for

Rushing headlong where forests border the horizon.
Dark hostile lands, where wild animals rule, are my home.
Where roaring waterfalls rush down rocky cliffs,
Wild unbridled water ruins banks,
Furrows its way through slopes and aims down, south.
Where storms do not end
At time of winter kingdom's frost,
Where bunches of mist are gathering
And fade away again
When pure pale morning illuminates white plaines with hoarfrost,
Where time stays unmoving
To be formed by moments of changes.

Using this part of my mind
Helps me bring into being
A thought that's meant to be
It's something I feel
Deep inside an inexorable
Fate of what's supposed to be
Meant to be
I let my mind take it's
Stroll through imagination
I think to myself how can I
Relate to this world
That can't begin to understand
Of how my mind is in demand
This world it creates is so
Truthfully innate
It's authentic actuality
Is something that's too good to be
This thought is purely meant to be
Thinking being
Thinking being"

Long as I can remember she's led my heart astray
When I was green as willow she had me ditchin' school
And even then she tricked me I'm just an April fool
She tangles dogwood blossoms into her yellow hair
She uses the same perfume the smoky mountains wear
She keeps the flame of summer round her neck like a jewel
She breezes in to see me and I'm an April fool
She entrances me and she dances me and she flies me like a kite
And I soon forget she's only come to play
Then there comes a day when she will not stay and I lie awake all night
Hoping next time April may
When I walked out this morning April had up and gone
And it was clear as water she'd only led me on
And it will be next winter before my heels will cool
And then I will forgive her I'm just an April fool
She knows I will forgive her I'm just an April fool"

Bukan senang nak simpan rambut panjang
Bila dah kerja office rambut mahu trim
Pakai pun mahu slack dan Pierre-Cardin

Travelled in endless trains

Far away from the Shamrock shore
So fare thee well, sweet Lisa, dear
And likewise to Derry town
And twice farewell to my comrades bold
Who still dwell on that sainted ground
If ever fortune, it should favor me
And I do have money in store
Well, I'll come back and I'll wed the sweet lassie I left
On Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore
We sailed three days, we were all seasick
Not one on board was free
We were all confined to our bunks
With no one to pity me
No fond mother dear, our father kind
To comfort my head went to sore
This made me think more on the girl I left
On Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore
Well, we safely reached the other side
In fifteen and twenty days
We were taken as passengers by a man
And he led us in six different ways
So then we all drank a parting glass
In case we'd never meet more
And we drank our health to old Ireland
And Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore

This is my postcard from Texas
What are the chances this town won't wreck us?
There is a woman, there always is
She's standin' on the side of the stage
beckoning motionless
And my legs get weak
and my heart beats fast
and I thought the love we had
was built to last
and my thoughts take off
where my hands want to go
and I know and I know and I know
Baby believe me
Baby believe me
I didn't do nothin'!
There's a strange black bird here
Which is mostly tall
makes a sound like an ambulance
That's her mating call
She sings a warning in the cold night air
she's out in the distance
she should be sleeping
but i can still hear her.
I'm steppin' out of a dream into a steamy car
and we huddle for safety at the cannibal bar
how far can I run away from this ring on my finger?
Is there a place where we can go to
shed our fear like clothes
and make love new?"

Free at last, from whip and oar

But now my dream starts to unfold.

The storm came down without remorse
And water crushed the rails
The ship was thrown back and forth
And strong wind ripped the sails
The icy waves embrace my skin,

The endless ocean swallows me
This will be, my cold wet tomb!

Each to fall prey with unnerving ease
To who knows which ambiguous marasmus
It asked at once knowing
And unknowing the answers
To things far removed from my experience
Or need to know and thus it thanked me
For sparing it death's multiplicitous masques
And life's thankless laborious tasks"

And we won't have to go through this
If I pretend to hold you tight
And out on the highway late some night
That's all right
If that's all that it takes
Even if my heart breaks
Darlin' I can wait
I have nothin' but time
And this poor heart of mine
Probably could use some rest
When the ghosts are all gone
You can leave your light on
Shinin' through the loneliness
Just like a beacon in the night
Brighter than any star in sight
But that's all right
For as long as it takes
For that mornin' to break

Feelin' so lonesome I could cry

You'll call me someday

About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.
Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad.
You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.
So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad.
So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will fuck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.
So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't fuck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad."

of all they owned
The revolution's cast the dictator from

With their execution, so ends the tyranny
Two bullets from a rifle set the people free

Pillage all their riches

Banished from the living

How did they feed the enormous greed

But now the monarchy is nullfied!

It's the dawning of a time

For their blatant disregard
They have suffered long and hard

Now they're free to speak, before they'd

Others died but not in vain, the people

Created in our dreams at night when we are asleep
Where all the creatures of the underworld lives
Never out in the light
Afraid to die in the morning light
To dust they crumble of they're touched by the daylight
She have always been there since the first tall tale was told by the fire
To their children before they tuck them into bed at night
Tale of a dream weaver
Stories about a beautiful siren
With a song that fool's every man to follow
She lives deep in the lake
Raving along in the full moons light
Watching her children play
Fooling around in the dead of night
Be home by dawn
Walk in the obscure
In the silence of the night
Don't wake the sleeping child
A window of glory light
From deep within our dream
From dusk till dawn, we can hear them ponder
In the night they come, from deep within
Frozen to stone, while asleep at night
The night awakens our fear
But were always saved by the morning light
They feed on our fear

As lights that glows in the night
Hiding under my bed

And I sent out a letter to my cousin up in Tennessee
And he brought down a blue tick hound she was pretty as she could be
Well they pinned her up in the swamplands
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
Well I'd take ol' red for his evenin' runs
I'd just drop him off and wait

And led me slowly down that long winding path to hear the word of God
And I seem to sense his presence more strongly there than anyplace I've ever known
There with the singin' of the birds and the humming of the bees
I knew that God was surely there
I knew it just as sure as if he'd laid his hand on my shoulder
And said welcome to my house son
Ah but years have passed and times has brought many heartaches and many tears
I've seen my mother pass onto the great beyond and many loved ones have followed
And I'd seen them go with dispairing hearts and tear dimmed eyes
And now in later days as I stroll along
The grassy footpaths to the old country churchyard
And I view the final resting place of my departed kin
I'm consoled by the thought that their sleep is a happy one
There in the place where God and men are one
And once again I seem to hear the voice of our gentle shepher saing

A place of which you'd never dream, there'd be a need to hide
For the building is surrounded by pastures pure and green
But the image hides reality and the distance kills the scream
That comes from inside is never exposed to the air
For the place is packed with scientists who show how much they care
While the guard stands bravely at the gate with guard dog by his side
The same breed of animal is butchered inside
Well, what a fucking waste of money, what a fucking waste of time
A fucking waste of money, what a fucking waste of time
A fucking waste of money, it's a fucking waste of time
What a waste of human knowledge, what a fucking way to die
There ain't no fucking truth in the inspector's files
As he walks down the death corridors, he covers his sighs with smiles
He sees the pain and agony but remembering his position
He's got his place, just another face but he's just not paid to question
He thinks it's rather funny because he's earning lots of money
When his eyes are forced aside as out slides another trolley
Another tray of corpses, unlabeled and unmentioned
But it's no good asking why, why because they never fucking listen
So, liberate
Animal testing to detect thalidomide
Torturing and killing while there's loads more things to try
The suffering and the pain, the excruciating pain
It all goes over and over gain

""Just after sunset on his way back to his camp after watching the sun unite

if waiting for him. His left eye missing. His beard as if gold. The signs
on his cloak and hood familiar. The one eyed old man matches the
description of the soothsayer, as told by the elders of his village by the
fires at night when he only a child. The boy, now a young man, eager to
know, asks the one eyed old man about his dreams. Dreams he cannot
understand. Dreams about strange things he is seeing himself doing. Then
the winds that seem to talk to him. Voices that whisper to him behind his
back. The one eyed old man tells him of the cycles of the stars, of the
trail of fate and of the valley where time and space had ceased to exist...
where his world ends and the shadows begin. The one eyed old man tells the
young man that fate has chosen him to interfere with the other world. The
disturbance is already made. The daughters of the four winds have sold
themselves to the shadows, distorting the balance of the universe. And the
one eyed old man says he has seen him come for a thousand years, and that
the aging gods have told him to teach him all that he has ever known and to
prepare him to ride beyond his world and into the shadows as their champion
to restore the balance. To his aid he shall be given a sword forged when
this world was young. He shall be guarded and guided by two ravens, and he
shall ride the eight-legged stallion of his fathers' god. He will encounter
the Woodwoman, and he will make a visit to the Lake. One hundred days and
one hundred nights his training shall be hard. And this very night it will
already have begun.

Keeps saying you'll hurt me
Do I dare to trust it at all

Darling you must
Or else I'll go out of my mind
When I'm not near you
I always fear you
Have somebody else on the line
Is it a fear
Or is it a knowing
A jealousy born out of truth
'Cause I watch you flirt
And it's how you embrace
Them with your eyes
That say I could lose

Make me feel loved
Tell me I've no need to fear
Just make me feel safe
Whatever it takes
Tell me what I need to hear

Your cherished and only true love
And sometimes I think
I'll die from this feeling

Can't you reach me

Long have we waited for this day
Now let us set out with our troops
Oh, yes, I long to pave their streets in blood
And ebb and flow with waves of gore
Long have we waited for this day

But don't your loins hunger for pure flesh?
Rip through the maidens, slay the men

Disturb me not when the battle dawns

Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder
A federal prosecuting drug-dealing witness
But that's how it is in the business
And I'm in it, physically gaining power
Constantly counting up cash by the hour
And it feels good to be paid
Regardless of how many victims get slayed
Accomplices of mine drop like flies
But in this everyday a homeboy dies
Whether shot in the body or cyanide in ya bacardi
'cause it's a cutthroat party
Now it's up to me to retaliate
And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate
I move on ones who double-cross
Set them up, now they suffer the loss
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes
The parts of a body is found days later
The other half was done by an amputator
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes
Just to keep control of my empire
I'll set ya own mother on fire
'cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time
Decapitated bodies found in lots
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks
Then retailed on the blocks
I drive around in expensive cars
And get women who fuck like porno stars
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose
Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively
Then started selling my customers ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like shaft
A character played by who? richard roundtree
The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by
Then all you hear is a last minute cry
Of those who triedto control my territory
Not the west side but the bed-stuy story
Police be giving me eye-to-eye contact
But I smile 'cause I'm putting out contracts
Now a g-note is placed upon ya head
You say picture that alright, bang ya dead

Not from a virgin alone as for god, the son of perdition he will be born in sin.
Like the great serpent in the wayside he sits,
Waiting to wound those who justice's path walks.
They will be killed in an agonizing death,
Struck with the poison of his wickedness.
God he raises the lowly, our king he casts them out.
Instead of condemn all the sinners, they will be magnified.
Sin stand for beauty, sin stands for life.
Sexual sin is every man's right.
He will exalt the wicked of man,
Our king the Antichrist.
Just as the lord and redeemer foresaw,
A suitable place for his son to be born.
So did the devil, he knew a place.
From which all evil could root,
It was Babylon.
He will come to Jerusalem with various tortures,
And slay all the Christians he can not convert to his cause.
He'll destroy the human race as far as he can,
And on the last day,
He will destroy himself.
God he raises the lowly, our king he casts them out.
Instead of condemn all the sinners, they will be magnified.

Condemned to swim against the grain

The bending sea forever circles around us all

Brought unto this world human inflicted

Why did we come this far to just turn back anyway?
We're auditioning for our own demise, and immune to the screaming

Cold and damp
A giant of a man in an oilskin coat, and a bundle that
Told he was a tramp
He stood at the bar and he called a pint, then turned
And gazed at the fire
On a night like this, to be save and dry is my one and
Only desire
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
Then in a voice that was hushed and low he said
""Listen, I'll tell you a tale""
How a man of the sea became a man of the road and never
More will set sail
I fished out of Howth and Killybegs, Ardglass and
Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on
The shore
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
One fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail
From Killybegs town
There were five of us from sweet Donegal and one from
County Down
We were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted
The cost
But I never thought 'ere that night was done, that my
Fine friends would all be lost
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown
But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends

Yeah, they didn't ride no horses though, man..
Did they have ladders up the side of them?
Oh yeah! No no, they just drove around in

Yeah, you could afford to do a load, you know.
I think the butler's gonna get them for me though.

That's a good idea. You know, the maid is mad at me.

I pinched her ass.

She had it coming.
That's right. Well, if you're gonna ride around on my

You're gonna get your ass pinched.

Reach for the sulphuric acid.
Writhe in burning agony.
Powerless to reject, scarred contentedness.
To ensure pleasure lingers, amputate your fingers.
Revel in your attempts, to create the ultimate pain.
Death would undermine, your frenzied theatrics.
No wish for final curtain, or grizzled finale.
As awareness plummets, into cloudy nothingness.
Enact the final scene, gargling nitro-glycerin."

The blood-red text on the planet Earth's epitaph
Here they lie, the human race
They fucked themselves, and laid Earth waste
Blind to the fact that the bomb was coming down
Their sanity was sold for a beggar's hand-out
What they got is what they made
The final act of this tragedy ends with pain
So drunk with power, they sit laughing at ground zero
One more drink, push a button, and let the fuckers go
It's a drama, it's a game, and lastly, it's a joke
What's left for the ones who never had a chance to know
That the powers inside are driven with the lust to fight
So they hand us their lies, and say it's gonna be alright
But the truth to it is, they tax us just to kill ourselves
And our very own bombs will blow us all to hell
Reckless, our neglect multiplies
The children of a cold war left behind, behind
Come and see the doctor, strange love is here
No other superpower means nothing to fear
Who needs a fucking treaty, when we got guns
Fuck the little countries, lets have some fun
Thinking back to where we came from
We can see how far we've come
But the price of our intentions
Burns us like the heat on the surface of the sun
Who can know what foul intentions
Start inside the human mind?
For only the proud human being could conjure up
A plan to obliterate his kind
The flash of light was quick to blind me
Much like the lies they told me before
So naive, we thought it was all over
But history returns with another world war"

To blur these images, etched upon my memory.
My stereo is where I go to let the sunshine in,
But every note`s like one from him.
All that surrounds me,

I saw the teardrops rolling down her cheeks
She said now don't you worry I'll be true
I'll hope and pray no harm will come to you

It made me stop and wonder who's to blame
That airport looked so big and then so small
I couldn't hold a teardrop back at all
He turned and ran to catch his waiting plane
She stood there crying calling out his name
She watched his plane go up into the sky
She waited until it was out of sight
Then she smiled and I thought Lord
She's lost her mind
But she reached into her purse and got a dime
She was smiling as she dropped the money in
She was smiling as she let the number ring

Is it this blood and heartbeat that you call life
Every effort to ignore it is unavailing, we all have to die
Is it too late to dull the edges of the pain, I have to try
This is an other dimension, you can scatter ashes to the winds
And even buried in the ground I'm still there
Do not be afraid, you are dying and the four great elements
Of your body are collapsing one into the other
It feels as if you are being crushed by mountains

But the light of the next world have not yet appeared

A town so damn small
There's nowhere to hide
Not a rock to crawl under
I guess you'll never know
What you left behind
I hope you always wonder
I'll go with my friends
Stay out all night
And end up getting wasted
And love someone I don't even like

How can you stab me in the back with no regret
Try and tell me you slipped just a little bit

How can you pretend you never knew me
I remember every inch of you
You'll be coming back when you find out
There's something missing
I don't want to get used to you being gone
There's a piece of my soul that's holding on
Something's missing
I don't want to believe in all the lies
I don't want to relive it every night

How can you stab in the back with no regret

And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside
Black day in July
Black day in July
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land
Black day in July
Black day in July
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavement
No reason can be found

And the people rise in anger
And the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops
And the blood begins to spill

There's nothing that is known for sure

And the pendulum is swinging
And they wonder how it happened
And they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature
And it wasn't just the season

And the news is quickly flashed
And you read your morning paper
And you sip your cup of tea
And you wonder just in passing
Is it him or is it me

In the office of the President
The deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see
It looks to us like anarchy
And then the tanks go rolling in
To patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate
The speech is made the dues can wait
Black day in July
Black day in July
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings
Strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen
And you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers
Why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the have-nots
Keep falling out of reach

Your baby pictures, us holding hands
Your first christmas, your mom and your dad
Smiling faces of the ones who loved us
Gone from this world, but they live here
If we had to do it all again
Then we'd do it, It was worth it
All of life's little memories
Are hanging, In our hallway
And if there ever comes a time
When this world tries, To pull you away
I'm hanging memories in our hallway
And those little nicks and scars
What was mine and what is yours
Someday there will come a time
When all that's left are photographs
Little frames of life that we once had
If we had to do it all again
Then we'd do it, It was worth it
All of life's little victories
Are hanging, In our hallway
Better part of the life we've lived
Is captured in these windows
And if there ever comes a time
When this world tries, To pull you away
I've hung some memories in our hallway"

Well I got me another girl
She looks like you at twenty... three
While she sleeps I trace the places that your tattoos used to be
We don't gotta lie, have you ever known
Us to take the night, lying down alone
I don't wanna try
Was hoping you were home
Hoping this is still your phone

When I get lonely, sure she'll do
But you're the only you
We were never very smart, we were sticking to our guns
We knew we had it up babe, we knew we were the ones
Forever barely starts, then suddenly someone's
Saying all it said and done

When I get lonely, sure she'll do
But you're the only you
I sprayed our names across the bridge
So the whole damn town would know
That bridge is gone
But some recall that whats his face hearts so and so
And so it goes... and so it goes

And keeps holding on, I'll give my all, To stand by your side,
For the rest of my life, It's true, Only for you,
From this moment on, I give you this woman's heart.
Don't be afraid, You can count on a love that's real,
Each step we take, I'll be by your side,
And we'll build our world together,Put your faith in me,
I promise that forever,
This woman's heart, beats steady and strong,
And keeps holding on, I'll give my all, to stand by your side,

Even in my folly
If the spotlight falls from my face
Or when I lose my grace
Oh well...
All her love is mine
Until the end of time
Even if the sun won't shine
Or the money runs dry
All her love is mine
Until the end of time,
Whatever happens then
She saved my life
In a manner of speaking
When she gave me back

His love moved across every inch of my body
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure
This morning when I opened my eyes
There to my surprise
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream
And so I said a little prayer
And thanked God, that he was there
Oh, this is a dream come true
Dream do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But now I do
Dreams do come true
It was love at first sight
And it was love all night
And the way he made love to me
Fulfilled all my fantasies

Show me where to direct all frustration
Wish I had the power to turn back

For you were
My only everything
Fractured
I fell to the floor
Fall, fall for cover, for cover
From truth that scars
And so I'm left bemused and still
Emotionless I'm in disbelief
It feels like I'm dreaming
But I can't stop the screams
Take the pain away from me
Burn so deeply
How can I live life without
You have paved the way for me
Gave me purpose
So I try to live life without you

An orderly solar system will outlast this guiding center system.
As we leave our galaxy, every certainty abandoned.
The referential lawns of man are lost, nothing is relative.
Cold and empty space surrounds and swells.
Time is moving at invariable speeds and our instruments are useless.
Oscillating obsession, beautiful apparatus.
These cycles put my mind at ease.

Vas a sentir lo que es el miedo de perder

In late December Cold of the Thousand Winter Season
Blackheim took Farewell of his Crypts in the Forestrealms
and Rode into the Horizonland Unreachable for Mortals
The Mighty Skies turned into a Colour of Blackest Midnight
Still the Winds knew where to Travel on a Forthblown Path
He Passed the Chasm so Below and the Home of Aurora Borealis
He would soon be Facing the Lurkers of Time - Life - Death
Blackheim's Quest to Bring back the Stolen Autumn
He exchanged his Sentinel Soul for a Serpent Sleeping in his Heart
and so September Appeared on Wings and was Brought back to his Land...
He exchanged his Sentinel Blood for Dragon's Breath Raging in his Lungs
and so October Appeared on Wings and was Brought back to his Land...
He exchanged his Sentinel Wisdom for Ashes Buried in his Eyes
and so November Appeared on Wings and was Brought back to his Land...
Blackheim finally Asked for December since the Sentinels of Life and Death
did not Know it was the month of Winter...
The Lurker of Time Cried out Blackheims Fooling Strategem
But the Sentinel was at one with Lightning
and Threw the Serpent into the Mouth of Time
Blew the Dragon's Breath with the Strength of a Demon
into the Eyes of Life the Lurker
Spread the Ashes in the Shadows of Death
and the Curse Dissolved with their Departure
Deathlike was the Century in this Horizonland oh so far Away
Cold and Blackened with no Sounds of Rejoice
Now He Held the Triumph High in Heart
Stormed over Fields with Might in Hand"

Boys we're living in a brave new world
Let me tell you what I've learned about girls
In this age of high tech and state of the art
When it comes to love you've still gotta talk to her heart
She can have a college degree MBA or a PhD
She can be strong and she can be smart
But when it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real
You got to tell her how you really do feel
Don't talk about fishin' don't talk about cars
Talk about the moon and talk about the stars
Tell her she's beautiful just talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real...
Well there's been a lot of changes since time began
But nothing's changed between a woman and a man
It's how things were it's how things are
When it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart

Noises of steel reins were broken in echoes
Air sweetened with blood
Pagan rabble
Fallen under the flag of antiquity.
I like to breath in and I devour greedily
Each little drop of the times passed away
Times of blood and of primary love as well.
In the evening falling into dark I speak to faces in the walls
They are much older than we are willing to understand
And also stronger than us, time and the power of oblivion
They are engraved into walls by songs from universe.
I like to listen to the narration of the endless labyrinth of horror
And at the same time I feel the most material and intoxicating power of
times
With which I feel to be bound."

Clouds of black were falling down
And rain that was freezing
When the lightning struck
The moonlight was plain and pale
And blinking sky still silent as death
Staring from the above
We felt the ghostly face of night
Damp covering its might
Sitting on the rock beyond the life
We stared again at the sky
Then the lightning struck hitting the tree
Standing so fearless on the hill
It was whispered to us to come by it
Feel the powers of nature so free
And now the nightingale was singing
Heard by two adventurers smiling
Under the moon that was now full
Mother nature in its infinity
We felt the ghostly face of night
Damp covering its might
Sitting on the rock beyond the life
We stared again at the sky
Still the betrothed are sitting beyond the life
And wondering the glory and the adore of night
And eternity calls all as the freedom
Calls us to dance in the twilight"

I'm a long way from you,
I'm a long way from home.
And who cares for the f
Of being alone.
The notes and the words
They will always unfold
And I'm left with a manuscript
That will grow old
And the secret's all told anyway.
So the song it is yours,
And the song it is mine.
And a cold wind it blows
Through good fortunes of time.
The hobo he leaves
When the going is bad
And the music he weaves
Is so gentle and sad.
But freedom he has anyway.

There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew
Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew
'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew
The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew"

Only makes our love more strong

The stereo and try not to think
And the record plays:

The policeman walked out, oh, so proud on his beat
When a vision came to him of stripes on his sleeve;
""Promotion,"" he whispered, ""I'll try for today,
So its come with me Mister Ri-tooral-i-ay.""
""Come tell me your name,"" says the limb of the law
To the little fat man selling wares on the straw.
""What's that, sir? Me name, sir? Why it's there on display
And it's Moses Ri-tooral-i-ooral-i-ay.""
Now, the trial it came on and it lasted a week.
One judge said 'twas German; another, 'twas Greek-
""Prove you're lrish,"" said the policeman ""and beyond it say nay;
And we'll sit on it, Moses Ri-tooral-i-ay.""
Now the prisoner stepped up there as stiff as a crutch.
""Are you lrish or English or German or Dutch?""
""I'm a Jew, sir; I'm a Jew, sir,"" that came over to stay.
And my name it is Moses Ri-tooral-i-ay.""
""We're two of a kind."" said the judge to the Jew;
""You're a cousin of Briscoe and I am one too.
This numbskull has blundered and for it will pay.""
""Wisha that's right,"" says Moses Ri-tooral-i-ay.
There's a garbage eollcctor who works down our strset;
He once was a policeman, the pride of his beat.
And he moans all the night and he groans all the day,
Singing,"" Moses Ri-tootal-i-ooral-i-ay. ""
Note: This reflects on the period when the Irish language was
outlawed in Ireland; the inability of the police to speak, or
even recognize the language presented enforcement problems.
Briscoe was Dublin's mayor. He was Jewish. (As the story
goes, ""only in America.""

Rolling over the highway Got the wind in my hair
While the sun is shining brightly down upon my face
Looking for an adventure Or for any old reason
That will lead me on a new exciting chase
I cant slow down I still have a lot to see
I'll blaze my path of glory from sea to shining sea.
Rolling over the highway
Rolling over the highway With the top of my car pulled down
While the radio is playing is turning back the years
Fingers tapping the dashboard Changing radio stations
Singing all the songs that are pleasing to my ears.
I've traveled through the countryside and I've seen a lot of towns
And I've waved hello to strangers when I've have my window down
Rolling over the highway
And I would take a trip to anywhere
As long as you were with me, I wouldn't have a care
Freedom must be wrestled from the grips of your existence
It doesn't take a miracle it only takes persistence.
Instrumental
Rolling over the highway Looking for a tomorrow
That only yesterday was impossible to see
Escaping to a forever Defining each moment
And accepting what it is I'm meant to be.
Heading to my future with my dream clutched in my hand
Arriving at the destiny of what it is I am

Assembling our forces in our way to the plains
From the Mithril mountains dwarves join us from their mines
Through dwarven mines I lead an invincible army
Across Dragonland our warcries will be heard
As we journey inward heading for the home of the elves
A forest of magic a place of tranquil glades
Through elven woods nothing can stop us now
Across Dragonland we shall carry on
Axe wielding berserkers, the dwarves' might will serve the light
Arrowpoints of Mithril, elven scouts always hitting their prey
Axe wielding berserkers, the dwarves' might will serve the light
Arrowpoints of Mithril, elven scouts always hitting their prey
My knights, my dwarves, my elves will fight for our dream
The one, the twisted evil one will now be brought down to his knees
Assembled our forces, now we ride to the plains
With power and with magic there is no way we can fail
Through dwarven mines I lead an invincible army
Through Elven woods nothing can stop us now"

A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
And the only home you'll know is the club down the street
A drinking and dancing to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Go out and have your fun, you think you've played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart"

[Lyrics: Chris Lykins]
[Solo: Chris]
Throughout our troubled history
Man's exploited fellow man.
Displaying xenophobic fear that's hard to understand
Centuries ago in Europe things were different than today
Foreigners were treated with respect not disdain
But dreams of power soon crushed this fine ideal
They set across the ocean in search of land to steal
They subjugated natives and stripped them of their rights
Sold them into slavery to demonstrate their might.
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state
[Chorus:]
Can't you see, it's a lie
Don't you know, that they've died
Trapped, by your hate
Stereotyped, convenient
Forced to be subservient
Taught by your state
All you pseudo-christians had yet to have your fun
You called them all subhuman
Justifying what you'd done
You sold them into slavery, every last one that you could
I guess that's only natural when you say its in their blood
Soon the racist theory spread to every colony
The crimes that you committed were for everyone to see
Depleted all their hunting grounds and chopped down hallowed woods
Set your plantations on the land
Where they once stood
[Chorus:]
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state
[Solo: Rick]
The hatred that you planted is still with us today
No longer simply slavery manifests in different ways
Keeps people in dead end jobs, reduces education
Maintain our racial sterotypes, encourages segregation
You propagate injustice saying they've done it to themselves
You lock them in your ghettos,
Deny them any wealth
The dogma you've created makes sure you never see
That underneath a different color
They're just like you and me
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state"

When you took my hand and said that you were cutting in
This stranger from Memphis was very polite
He said you sure do have a lovely wife
Wife, he thought i was your wife
Well that's what got me thinking, it's like someone slammed the door
You just want to girlfriend, i want so much more
You ask me what's the hurry? you say let's take our time
Well i say our time it just flew"

And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd spent our lives on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land
Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are
Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
My old southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And I know they're thinking of me
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands
Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
These old southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
If I'll keep looking to the Father
He'll keep my heads above the water
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong

And listen to you breathe
It's like the ocean sound
Whispering through the trees
In the hollow of your shoulder
There's a tide pool of my tears
Where the waves came crashing over
And the shoreline disappears
Baby close your eyes
Fly back there with me
Where the phosphor shines
Green flashlights from the sea
Our nets were full of soft shells
Our hearts were free from toil
And we made love on the kitchen table
Till the water reached a boil
We hold it all for a little while, don't we...
Kiss the dice, taste the rain
Like little knives upon our tongue
We can do no wrong when the lights come on
And the music plays
And we take the stage like we own the place
As if time were cheap and the night forever young
So let 'em turn my soul

Is it about being down with the scene

It's not having to wonder whether or not you might lose it
It can't be about material gain

The steel church is the savior of life

Take me take me to a church of steel on steel
Take me take me to a world I can lose my grace
Take me take me to a hell of steel on steel

When I can get more there's no time to waste for romance
Show me how to maltreat to lie and to cheat
To fight steel on steel

Itll warm your frozen bones
Vivid violet clothes
In their candy overtones
When the lavender returns
Itll race across the land
Rebel flower grows
In the palm of your free hand
If you look out your window
The grounds parched and bare
If you call for your lover
Shes no longer there
If you ponder your life
Well, it feels like a wreck
And your failures are scars
You can never forget
As leaves turn brown
Sky fades to grey
Youre feeling the drought
The end of the day
Its been lonely here
In this World of Fallen Souls
Its been lonely here
With nowhere left to go
But dont give up
Dont despair
Taste the hope

Nothing's sacred
No one is pure

Has changed through the years
What truth are lies?
What lies are truth?
Madness as my disguise
I do what I do
This world created holy
Is tortured and haunted
Metamorphosis of a monster
Just goes to show
Not all are Satan's slaves
Supposed holy doing his dirty work
They're digging the earth's own grave
One grave...
The bowels of the earth
Are ready to give birth
The death noise will crack the sky
A moments reflection
Mirrored imperfection
Then all madness will subside
One day the whales will walk the earth
The hunter will become the hunted
Mammoth will unearth itself from the tomb of hibernation
He will sprout wings and fly
Man will be consumed by fire then condemned to the sea
Burning eternally with salty water in the lung
Reborn, Reformed, The humble will adorn a new way
Without treachery or scorn

So where is the party going on?

So save your judgments for someone else
And be grateful I saved me from myself

To lead them out the dead zone
It's plain and clear
Don't spend eternity here
With others like them
Who took their own life out of fear
Why couldn't they just see that everybody's got a time?
Let the Reaper do his job, man

Take me outdoors, feed me

Not afraid to die, cause death is afraid of us
We're meaner then the devil
But we're someone you can trust
We're used to being shut down
And pushed out the doorway
Death doesn't want us so we're fucking here to stay
You're way to fresh for death to want you,
with abilities and talents no one can ever come close to,
Suppose you don't lose,
Stay on track,
You don't know if you don't try,
Always remember that,

Hold up now and think about this shit,
Why the fuck death wanna pay you a visit,
I been waitin' 30 years and nothin',
So what makes you think you so special motha fucka,
I been knockin' on his forehead,
And peep this,
All that bitch did was bring me a gang of kids,
Maybe more people for later times,
But for now I know he don't wanna fuck with me and mines,
If I contemplated dying,
Then really I would be lying,
And trying to get to heaven is really another question,
I'm guessing another lesson,
And living ain't really needed,
But since I been getting weeded,
Defeated has been deleted,
I seen it but don't believe it,
My eyes just run and hide,
And at the same time they collide with the other side,
Bleeds pride and courage until the day that I die,
Now put your lotus in the motha fuckin' sky

So bring the wicked shit, we gonna bring it too

Sing little birdie

Thinking about one tiny grain of sand

If I be a rambling boy
The sporting life

Met a lady from Louisville
A-pleasing to my mind
She took my hand and said
Would you please be kind
And from the foggy dew I stumbled
Into a shady grove
Where the redbird sang his sweet song
He sang of careless love
And the bells of Rhymney rang out
And brought the people round
Saying welcome to your friendly travelling man

With how sad steps You climb the skies !
How silently, how pale Your face...
What may it be, that even in this place
that busy archer his arrows tries ?
Liebe verendet zu Staub und verlabt mich
Mein Geist, er schaut auf zu den hoheren
Zielen und reichert fur mich Unvergangliches
an, Vergangliches bringt mir nur
endliche Freuden
Leave me, oh love, which reachest but to dust
And You, my mind, aspire to higher things
Grow rich in that which never takes rust
What ever fades but fading pleasure brings
Verbreite die Strahlen, gib' mir Deine Macht,
die die Wolken besiegt und das Licht mir bewegt
durch den Fruhling des goldnen belebenden Blickes
Ich suche den Weg in der Dammerung schwer
And let the day be time enough to mourn
Let walking eyes suffice to vail their scorn
The shipwreck of my ill-adventured youth
Without the torment of the night's untruth"

Listen, I've been drinking
as our house lies in ruin.
I don't know what I'm doing
alone in the dark
at the park or at the pier,
watching ships disappear in the rain.
The world's just bones.
The world is black stones dressed up in the rain
with no place to go but home-
just like Nance.
On a night like this, why, she's pro-stars, pro-sky.
All lit up and sick of fighting
beneath the diseased lighting of the discotheque at night.
It don't mean a thing. It never means a thing.
It don't mean a thing. It never means a thing.
It's got that swing.
I've seen it all. I've seen it all.
Magnolia's a girl. Her heart's made of wood.
As apocalypses go, that's pretty good.
Sha-la-la, wouldn't you say?
Please remove your spurs.
Come to think of it, remove your antlers.
Haven't seen you for ages.
I still fly into rages at the mention of your name,
Christine White.
I think about you often, off in the desert,
laughing your head off in the Forest of the Night.
Say a prayer for the light.
So now I live well. I live in the mine.
I'm still slinging mud at the towers all the time.
I took a walk
and threw up in an English Garden.
I was born in the North, but my father's from the South.
Love is a political beast with jaws for a mouth. I don't care!
You're upset- and have every right to be.
Regretfully, you decline.
Every night was a waste of time.
Every night. Every night. Every night.
You were on the side of good.
I was inside of the sea's guts,
a crumbling beauty trapped in a river of ice.
A crumbling beauty trapped in Paradise,
oh yes, it was Paradise!
The tide comes in and the tide goes out again.
I suppose this is the kind of thing we see every day.
The tide comes in. The tide goes away.
Oh, the tide comes in. Yeah, the tide. Yes, the tide.
A ransom note written on the night sky above
reminds me what-in-particular about this wine I love.
Like a punctured beast, better-off dead,
compliments going to my head:
La-da-da, la-da-da!
And speaking of my mind (the Sunflower),
and speaking of a world turning sour on you,
I was twenty years old in 1992.
I was bathed in golden sunlight, alright?
I was ripped on dope. You were a ray of sunshine.
I was a hopeless romantic. You were swine.
You've got to spend money to make money.
You've got to stop calling me ""honey"".
Oh world! You fucking explosion that turns us around!
The searchlight slumps over, so sick of the night,
and the kids on the boats, busted in the shipyard
going down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
You traveled light (all night, every night),
to arrive at the conclusion
of the world's inutterable secret,
and you shut your mouth.
I've seen it all. I've seen it all. I've seen it all.
Free and easy. Gentle. Gentle.
The wind through the trees makes you mental for me.

And then with their last breath
They built the roads they would ride to their deaths
Driving on through the night unable to break away

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your hands
Do you remember the story of the Promised land
How he crossed the desert sands
And could not enter the Chosen Land
On the banks of the river he stayed
To face the price you pay
So let the games start
You better run you little wild heart
You can run through all the nights and all the days
But just across the county line
A stranger passin' through put up a sign
That counts so many fallen away
To the price you pay,
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay"

Break your heart you've got your own self to blame
I've played it smart so many times, but that all changed
From the moment you were mine
People fall in love and swear they are so sure
Then they turn around and say it's over
I never trusted love to come any closer
Till the moment you were mine
One moment in time
And I knew why I had waited so long
One look in your eyes
Meant forever from that moment on
I used to dream somebody's arms were around me
Wake up all alone and feel so empty
No I never dreamed how real love could be
Till the moment you were mine
One moment in time
And I knew why I had waited so long

Fresh off the road and pretty tired
Didn't have to worry cause the ice is always broken
As we catch each others eyes across the fire
Had a couple of drinks and a conversation
About what's going on beneath the surface
Told you how hard it was and I know you really listen
And you make me see it's all worth it
And once again it feels so good to be with friends like you
You are the ones
You are the reason I'm not scared to step into the fight
You are the soul you are the hope
You are the carriers of the light
I'd never write a song this true
Never be me without you

More going on than meets the eye
Things were transforming
There was smoked and I passed through it
When it cleared I could hear the dance music
The dance music the dance music

This empty shell cares no longer for life.
Slowly replacing the flesh with steel,
So that I may carry on...
Unfettered by this mortality.
The air no longer carries favour,
The water that passes these lips
Keeps only this mortal shell alive.
For hope has been not here,
Nor raised in it's form.
And all is lost again.
Eradicate the shadows, That dements these thoughts.
And if I were to enter slumber?
Only sleep, guarded by a sense I may never wake,
Slipping into narcoleptic state.
Seas of tormented bliss,
Ebb away from these barren shores.
Nothing remains.
Only pieces of this intimate jigsaw
...And 'tis upon me again.
The clock ticks on
And still I remain.
Death wrenched upon my eyes,
To the birth of a second sight.
Visions surround,
The haze of my labyrinth,
Angles of dimensions unreal, unseen.
Blood, in the deep of my eyes,
Fires within the mountain.
'Tis within my grasp.
The point that will shall eventually reach,
And shall have no return"

How can all this be

Coming down on me
I've stayed one step

But now the cracks of doom
Snakes across my back
like lightning
Burning bright
My soul is dying
Watch out for the thunder
Throw the lights upon me
Like diamonds on the sky
Music is my magic
And magic is my high
But still they keep on striking
Those flaming whips of steel
Won't you tell me
What you want from me?
I'm running
I'm screaming
I'm fling like a fallen

Can't you feel my thunder

No sleep for the metal demon
No rest for the wicked

1. Oh, the summer time is coming,
And the trees are sweetly blooming,
And the wild mountain thyme
grows around the blooming heather.
Chorus:
Will you go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather,
Will you go lassie, go?
2. I will build my love a bower
By yon clear and crystal fountain,
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain.
3. If my true love, she won't have me,
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather.
4. Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather.

It's negative imagery that preys upon our young,
How could we be so blind?
Now we step inside conceptually a different view,
And uncover the horror that we're injecting into
All our children's minds.
Born into a peasant monarchy,
A life of inherited luxury.
This newborn Prince with his silver spoon,
His life unfolds and will change soon.
His father, the King, is not ever around,
Never deigning to walk on his own son's ground.
A tragic young life spent in a broken home,
Looking forward to years of life alone.
Leading the life of hell,
His story, you know it well.
In death he'd finally be free,
Could this be what it seems to be?
As this Prince enters his first few years,
A menagerie known as his friends appears,
Misfits one and all.
One, who lives to create turbulence,
Another, who straddles an androgynous fence,
And we're not sure where he'll fall.
Minute is his contact with the outside world,
Unhardened to the likely peril it holds.
Until one day, with his mother, the Queen,
He's thrust into a ghastly scene.
Like animals, with weapons they're pursued,
By men with butcherous attitudes.
His mother, the victem of the ""Thrill Of The Chase"",
With a bullet, she loses this deathrace.
Leading the life of hell,
His story, you know it well.
In death he'd finally be free,
Could this be what it seems to be?
Then his woman is forced into
A precarious position and looks doomed.
Assaulted and raped by more than one
Members of a gang that are on the hunt.
Add to this the destructiveness
Of the fire that rages without rest,
Decimating his neighborhood,
Torching his land where his home once stood.
Brutal cinematic display, upon our children's minds it preys.
A subtle induction into horror, with implications we can't ignore.
Malevolence hidden behind doe-eyes, how many see through its disguise?
Burning itself into the minds it haunts,
Is this really what we want?
Leading the life of hell,
His story, you know it well.
In death he'd finally be free,
Could this be what it seems to be?"

Cause there was caution to consider, a consequence for haste
Now there's sorrow in the morning, the evening feels like waste

But sunny, clear, the day you died
I had a feeling, I think, or do I just have it now
That it was all over, that I was done somehow
And gracious was your beauty

As the moon kisses the sea and casts it's glitter on the water and majestically silence engulfes the lands, a dream woven of bitterness, joy and desire stealthfully embraces my solitary heart.
Horis lucis simplex
crescere, et somniator.
Repudiatur nam sensus
ab simplice redeor.
Through scies of charming beauty, up to the stars devine, my mind lifts up enchanted, casts of all earthly chains. Subdued by nights sensation, engulfed by sweet temptation I kiss the seals of slumber and let my spirit dream.
Doubtful thoughts pull back my heart. The flame of delight chases to burn.
For every smile shall wither, the hopeful laughter fade, the cup of joys illusions bashed from the craving lips. And as all hopes are shattered, the last of passions scattered, the gale of bitter failure is all that shall remain.
Cursed by my creator and the spark of existence, so unvoluntary bestowed. Come forth spirits of my solitary past, emotions of havok and destruction be unleashed.
I wonder if I ever could regain the virtues I have cast off long ago.
I wonder if my eyes will ever catch a token of the sympathy I still crave.
And all emotion of my former days dilute. For I shall learn how to live with the truth. Soon I shall strip off the boundaries of hope.
For a caring soul.
Der fluchtig Vergnugungen mude, der Tag voller qualvollem frust.
Wann mag der einst wohlvertraut friede, endlich wieder erfullen die Brust. Und als der guldnen Sterne Glanz verging und des
Morgens Rot am Himmel hing da ward des Nachtens Freud und Bluck zerstoben ein neuer jamervoller Tag erhoben.
Wohin verflogen der Stunden Zeit wohin des Nachts verhullnd Barmherzigkeit.
So flieht mein Sinn dem Bimmel bleich in Trubsinn schwer an Kummer reich."

The farewell of the year
And evening shadows gather Ã¢EËround
And cloud the soul with fear
But rest you well good Christian men
Nor be of heart forlorn
DecemberÃ¢E(tm)s darkness brings again
The light of Christmas morn
Ã¢EËTwas when the world was waxing old
And night on Bethlehem lay
The shepherds saw the heavÃ¢E(tm)ns unfold
A light beyond the day
Such glory neÃ¢E(tm)er had visited
A world with sin outworn
But yet more glorious light is shed
On happy Christmas morn
The welcome snow each Christmastide
Falls shining from the skies
On village paths and uplands wide
All holy white, it lies
It crowns with pearl, the oaks and pines
And glitters on the thorn
But purer still the light that shines
On gladsome Christmas morn
The shepherds poor, how blest were they
The angel song to hear
In manger cradle, as he lay
To greet the Saviour dear
The Lord of heavÃ¢E(tm)nÃ¢E(tm)s eternal height
For us a babe was born
And He, the very light of light
Shone forth that Christmas morn
The chapel lights above the snow
Do warm the coldest chill
And manger scene, by candle glow
Inclines us to goodwill
Ablaze in wonder and in awe
As every heart adores
But brighter still, the light that falls
On gladsome Christmas morn
And oÃ¢E(tm)er the child a guiding star
Shall lead us into peace
And still in souls, that childlike are
His guardian love shall be
Oh then rejoice, good Christian men
Nor be of heart forlorn
For unto you, in Bethlehem
The Son of God is born
DecemberÃ¢E(tm)s darkness brings again
The light of Christmas morn."

Old Ireland's surrounded with sadness and gloom,
We were defeated and shamefuIIy treated,
And I, Robert Emmet, awaiting my doom.
Hung, drawn and quartered, sure that was my sentence,
But soon I will show them no coward am I.
My crime is the love of the land I was born in,
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.

Bold Robert Emmet will die with a smile,
Farewell companions both loyal and daring,
I'll lay down my life for the Emerald Isle.
The barque lay at anchor awaiting to bring me
Over the billows to the land of the free;
But I must see my sweetheart for I know she will cheer me,
And with her I will sail far over the sea.
But I was arrested and cast into prison,
Tried as a traitor, a rebel, a spy;
But no man can call me a knave or a coward,
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.
chorus:
Hark! I the bell's tolling, I well know its meaning,
My poor heart tells me it is my death knell;
In come the clergy, the warder is leading,
I have no friends here to bid me farewell.
Goodbye, old Ireland, my parents and sweetheart,
Companions in arms to forget you must try;
I am proud of the honour, it was only my duty-
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.

And our city streets are filled with angry men

The youth's immersed in poison--turn the tide
counterattack. Violence against violence, let the roundups begin.
A firestorm to purify the bane that society drowns in. No
mercy, no exceptions, a declaration of total war.
The innocents' defense is the reason it's waged for.
Born addicted, beaten
and neglected. Families torn apart, detroyed and abandoned.
Children sell their bodies, from their high they fall to drown.
Demons crazed by greed cut bystanders down.
A chemically tainted welfare generation.
Abslolute complete moral degeneration.
Born addicted, beaten and neglected.
Families torn apart, detroyed and abandoned.
Children sell their bodies, from their high
they fall to drown. Demons crazed by greed cut bystanders down.
Corrupt politicans, corrupt enforcement, drug lords and
dealers; all must fall. The helpless are crying out.
We have risen to their call. A firestorm to purify.
Forged in the flames of chaos.
Hammered by trials to tempered steel. Convictions, tried and tested,
onto a razor's edge, that's true and real.
Wrought between the hammer and the anvil, strengthened to never break.
The weakness that surrounds is the evil that I forsake.
Never have I taken in vain the sacred vessel of my soul. I am the master
of my faith, my destiny I control. Nobility lies in actions,
corrections where once was wrong. Ascension from evil with a
heart that's true and strong. Through this veil of shadows,
the light of truth is my only guide. A knight unyielding. To the X I'm crucified."

I've done too much of some things
And not enough of others
Just like all life lovers
I've changed and changed,
And changed and changed
From one thing to another.
I've had complicated dealings
With complicated feelings
And I've cut and bruised and torn.
I made blinds on the windows of my mind
with the time that my back once wore.
I'm a single person in this universe,
And I am here to say to you:
On the day that I die
I'll just give a smile
And fly into the blue!
Cause we're all just-
Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
That rest on a Sunday
Work on a Monday and someday soon
We'll be singing the old tunes
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, Zip-a-dee-doo
I'll be sitting on the porch with you
Then I'll die and I'll
Fly off into the blue!
Some night I see the world with its winds and its whirls,
And I feel undefeated
But every day I see the girl with the strawberry curl,
And I'm too shy to meet her.
Some nights I go to bed,
There's a ghost in the air above my head,
And I tremble.
Sometimes I eat KFC
Other times I give up meat
And I just eat lentils.
I'm a singe soul on this big blue ball,
And I am here to sing a song
About the day that I was born
Till the day that I'll be gone
And the song won't last for long,
(Cause we're all just)
CHORUS
And enemy is a remedy to a malady in your melody
If you're strong not brittle.
And a friend is a friend
Is a friend to the end and it's AH so simple
A man is a man and a woman is a woman
But the times we are living in demand
That a man can change from a man to a woman
And a woman can demand to be a man.
We're just flesh with socks and locks and frocks,
And I am here to say to you!
On the day that I die I'll just give a smile and fly into the blue...
Cause we're all just

Summoned the gods and they all approved
Bad vibes akimbo on the shelf
Bit of a rap thing going for myself
This gold on the teeth's no sense at all
It only matters when it's on the wall
I'm standing here with my four men
Let's start that rapping thing again:
Marco, merrick, terry lee, gary tibbs and yours truly
In the naughty north and in the sexy south
We're all singing I have the mouth
In the naughty north and in the sexy south
We're all singing I have the mouth

So tired of anarchists looking at me
Don't need their credibility
""Destroy,"" they say, ""defy! Condemn! ""
As long as you don't destroy them
With twenty years of drugs and drink
I thought the time had come to think
About standing up and saying that
It's tragedy and such old hat
I'm standing here with my four men

These happy feet are all we need
Summoned the gods and they all agreed
These feet won't stop they're in such a hurry
I knock it on the head and I go for a curry
Staying sober can be neat
Get drunk on these here happy feet
Keep on trying to pin me down
""Why a title for your sound? ""

Endless travels
Through laws of nature
Opening boxes, oh what a find
Maximum pain with minimal pleasure
Strive for the things that you never can have
Chasing a dream that seems so appealing

Breaking free from the horde of norm
Futile transition, plenty of residue

That sleeps down at the foot of the cave kills off the big rats
I think I'ed like to see this guy well I might just maybe
But everybody in the little bitty town they say he's crazy
I asked a fellow what the story was asked him just what happeded
He said boy sit down let me tell you about this mountain wild man
Mountain wild man up on the mountain
Mountain wild man up on the mountain
He had a job and a wife and a little bitty boy and things were just fine
Till he caught that woman out a runnin' around and it kinda messed up his mind
So he went to the bar and he had a few drinks and he did a lot of thinking
He could either kill that cheatin' woman or drown his sorrows drinking
Well he knew he couldn't kill that cheatin' woman or they'd put him in a prison
And his heart and pride were too damn strong for him to go to drinking
So he broke the bonds of society and started walkin'
He bought a rifle and an ax and a big Bowie knife and went to the mountains
Mountain wild man...
Boy I'm gonna tell you something your momma probably never told you
Just what she never told you bout your pa and why he left you
Now you've heard the story of why he left this land
Well boy I know who your p's is he's the Mountain Wild Man

I stepped out into thin air
Into a perfume so rarefied
""Here comes the bride""
Not quite aside, they snide, ""she's number four""
""There's number three just by the door""
Those in the know, don't even flatter her, they go one better
""She was selling speedboats in a trade show when I met her""
Look at her now
She's starting to yawn
She looks like she was born to it
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
She reaches out her arms to me
Imploring ""another melody?""
So she can dance her husband out on the floor
The captains of industry just lie there where they fall
In an eau-de-nil and pale carnation
A satin sash and velvet elevation
She straightens the tipsy headdress of her spouse
While hers recalls a honey house
There'll be no sorrows left to drown
Early in the morning in your evening gown
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
The entrance hall was arranged with hostesses and ushers
Who turned out to be the younger wives nursing schoolgirl crushes
Parting the waves of those few feint friends
Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend
The ghostly first wife glides up on stage whispering to raucous talkers
Spilling family secrets out to flunkies and castrato walkers
See that girl
Watch that scene
Digging the ""Dancing Queen""
Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks
Running a book on which of them is going to last the week
One of them calls to me and he says, ""I know you""
""You gave me this tattoo back in eighty-two""
""You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug""
""And I was a shaven-headed seaside thug""
""Things haven't really changed that much""
""One of us is still getting paid too much""
There are some things I can't report
The memory of his last retort
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
Look at me now

'You never came for me.'
Ive always been alone in love.
An 'IOU' note signed by love herself.
Id never doubted, tomorrow will be the day when every mans hero will be mine.
Tomorrow never came.
This promise Ive held onto for so long,
But tonight Ill hold a lie, and my love will never be the same.

And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What I might say
There's a message
In the wild
And I'm sending you
This signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard
To understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no
No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you"

Ending in a murder scene
And I'm not such a man
Never been so brave or grand
But little one
I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A dazzling sky
The heroes of youth
A burning ache
Resurrecting Truth
My dreamy one
I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A guiding hand
Wipes the greed away
A whistle blown
Digs corruption's grave
My dreamy one
I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A jasmine wind
Turns the air so sweet
A cleansing spring
Washes stained elites
Oh, little one
I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A brilliant star
'Bove a poor man's house
A treasure chest
Let the magic out
My dreamy one
I had a dream
Oh, dreamy one, Oh, dreamy one
I had a dream...
This shadow of a man
Had a dream he can't forget
A shadow with a dream
A nation changed, a nation blessed
And let us sing...
Lux et Veritas... Victoria
Let's make our dreams come true
Lux et Veritas... Victoria
And the dream begins with you
My dreamy one
I had a dream
A nation changed
A nation blessed"

All the way to Jericho all the while singin' low

All the way to Jericho in a rusted automobile

then you wait for early light

""Lover Du Jour""
What are you looking at, lover boy?
It won't do you any good
Cause I know your kind
If you wanna be mine
We gotta get this understood
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell for you, for sure
If you think I will be, I'll be your lover du jour
I'm what? (Lover du jour) Not me!
I am well aware of your good looks and se*y ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
The fresh catch of the day on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready just having it your way
Well, if I'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight (Lover du jour)
Me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
Don't need one place to order if you believe that I
I'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
Oubliez-moi! Forget me!
Still looking, lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no merit from you!
That's crap!
If you want something appetizing
Something real and satisfying
I'll be worth a second look, but that's the only way!
Cause, I'm not gonna be your, be your l'amour du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Cause I won't be caught up in all your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your lover du jour
No, I am not for your amusement
I am not a toy, you are nothing but trouble
You are a bad bad boy! (l'amour du jour)
I am a tasty starter around a full course meal
Desert half after dinner drink, and you can have no feel...
Pardon my French ...
Any questions?
Ugh, my French is awful but my love is awesome
They gonna laugh at me in France, sorry..."

I've gotta get out of here
So I can save our family
From this poverty
And when I make my money
I'll send it back to you

Give me strength, I pray
I have to end this misery
It's causing too much pain
I'm gonna look for richer lands
Where the money's made
I'm gonna put my whole World
In your hands
I have to put my whole World
In your hands
In your hands

Please let me work somehow
You've kept me waiting 18 months
And still I'm not allowed
And every time you promise me
""Not much longer now""
I've had to put my whole world
In your hands
I'm gonna put my whole world
In your hands
In your hands
Hey, hey, oho
Listen, listen to me
Mister! Mister! You say you're trying
But don't you know my brother's dying
You say ""it won't be long""
But why am I so cursed
For where I am born?
I know
You've got my whole world
In your hands
I've had to put my whole world

I've had to put my whole world

Trying to remember what I said
I say that I won't call you
And I mean it every time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
I wish that I could tell you why I call
Sometimes it's just hard for me, that's all
I know that it's over and it's just a waste of time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
Memories of you surround me and
I'm afraid the tears might drown me
I think I'm doing fine
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
It's good that I just do this now and then
You know I'm really not a drinking man
(But) I can't bear to talk about us any other time

I'd pressure her old man
To let me take her back to texas
In the white pickup truck
Where she had done a dozen favors
To get me out of dutch

And the house is pretty small
And I never learned the language
Of old guatamal
But there are frijoles when I'm hungry
And I drink tequila when I'm dry
And the coffee is oh so good
And maria hands it out
