Here we go, right
Hey Five [Incomprehensible], what do you got now?
Why do you put up a fight with your feelings?
Girl we've been friends now for far too long
I know some part of you thinks that I'm schemin'
But there's no way I could do you wrong
I said love, you said it ain't that
Then you turn around and come back
I can tell the way that you act
That you want this
Don't you fight it girl it's only natural
Can't disguise what's in your eyes they say too much
Don't deny that when we touch it's physical
Let it be, you and me, don't fight it, baby
Don't need to tell me we're riskin' this friendship
But there's no stoppin' this vibe we're on
And when we play I can feel we're not jokin'
In every stare that we share too long
I said love, you said it ain't that
Then you turn around and come back
I can tell the way that you act
That you want this
Don't you fight it girl it's only natural
Can't disguise what's in your eyes they say too much
Don't deny that when we touch it's physical
Let it be, you and me, don't fight it, baby
What everybody knows, don't fight it baby
Just let you're feelings show, don't fight it baby
Don't wanna let it go, why fight it baby?
Look to your heart and you'll know that you want it
Baby you know you make me feel real hot
Keep you body shakin' show me what you got, yeah

347605,"atom-and-his-package","head of septa nose of me","i know.
i could have been dead.
my nose swelled up to the size of my head.
the fucking gate, man, that shit was half lowered.
i did not see it, so i put my gear in forward.
and the lights that came,
were like a flash of lightning in the pouring rain.
i got up to a stranger's stare.
i touched my finger to my nose to make sure it was still there.
i want the head of septa, to come to my house
and kiss the nose of me 'til it feels better.
i went. no, it didn't make sense.
someone had tampered with the evidence.
so i called the cops, and filled out a report.
oh mr. big butt septa, i will see you in court"

They won't see the approaching ledge
Too much time and effort spent on just another bridge
We trust the local doctor
We trust the medicine
Our child gets a scratch
We give our child a brand new head
We eat what's on our plate
We drink what's in our cup
We like the shiny tv screen
It spits we lap it up
And so they push this product
And they know we'll buy it
They sing a song
We hum along
We sing
But we don't understand the words to the song
And they fill our heads
With sugar coated shit
Cause there's no need to talk
When we have medicine
There's a pill for every fucked up thought
And a cure for every fucked up child
When the mind starts running
Be sure it won't cross the finish line
And if it wanders
Bring it back and cage it for some time
And if it stretches
It will only one day rip
To prevent excessive thought
Just keep it up on the shelf
And when the shelves are full
And supplies are short
And quickly running out
You've got a thousand mindless zombies
And terrified horses on your hands
It was a damn good plan
It was a damn good plan"
200042,"diamond-rio","finish what we started","Lyin' on our backs
We stared at the stars
Tryin' to count them
Or guess how far
I still remember
The way that it felt
The night we hung our dreams
Out on Orion's belt
The moonlight danced
Out on the water's edge
We started a walk
That hasn't ended yet
[Chorus]
And step by step
And mile by mile
Taking each turn together
Following the signs
That point to forever
And side by side
True and tenderhearted
We'll finish what we started
The road we have traveled
Has sometimes been steep
And we've crossed troubled waters
That were raging and deep
But with memories to lean on
And love as our guide
There's no path too winding,
No river too wide
One foot in front
Of the other each day
Keeping a promise
That two young lovers made
[Chorus]"

The full desire of this prisoner
You walk where angels fear to go
Thou shalt soon embrace the reckoner
Thy halo of glory, hope's true gage
May prove to be an evil pilgrimage"

Again, why must it be
A man is drowning slowly
And he can't keep above
Gone way to deep, oh yeah
Open skies are falling
Tears are coming down
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around
One rainy day
Oh so many times I should've crawled when I went running by
And since then I've been left feeling traumatized
Raped and drained of an innocence
A gift we've lost over time
And still I gaze through this one rainy day
Alone with no one by my side
Open skies are falling
Tears are coming down
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around, yeah
I swear I've given, I've given you all I can
Never will you ever make me feel this way again, oh
On this one rainy day"

The skies are so gray and the heart you left broken is lonely
The winter wind blows through the trees and with the song I sing
I long for the days you loved me only
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new
Young hearts so tender in their yearning
But seasons, change and lovers too
And winter's twice as cold
But the fire in one heart is always burning
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain
And what was love is just a spell that's broken
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do
Seems our hearts have never really spoken
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart"
