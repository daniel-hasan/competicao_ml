So I heard you bought a lousy dream
You took a number from the star machine
The star machine is spitting numbers all on you

You say it

You leave your family and some friends behind
It wasn't long until you lost your mind
The star machine is doing fine, but how are you?
You told the world you had to fire the band
Your little world has gotten out of hand
The star machine will hand your ass right back to you

Some snow for Johnny
He wants to build
A big snowman
It was a week just before Christmas
Way down in Louisiana
A little boy was kneeling by his bed
In a manner poised and grand
I listened as he said his prayers
His voice came soft and low
He said, ""God tell Saint Nicholas
To send a little snow""
Please send some snow
Some snow for Johnny
He wants to build
A big snowman
I'd like to build a snowman
Like the other children do
I've got an old top hat and a walking cane
Got a big long cigar too
Yes, everything is ready
And I'm all set to go
How can I build a snowman
When I haven't any snow
Please send some snow
Some snow for Johnny
He wants to build
A big snowman
Now, early Christmas morning
Much to his surprise
Snowflakes by the million
Were falling from the skies
Down the stairs and out-of-doors
As fast as he could go
So happy that Saint Nicholas
Had sent a little snow
Thanks for the snow
The snow for Johnny
Now he can build
A big snowman

The snow for Johnny

Lyrics: Hirsch August '94
Creeping upon my soul, the disease was blinding me
The vulture's shadow was out of reach
The carcass of hope I could not see
My spirit trapped by midnight, deeper down it sank
I gasped at the land of shadows
At last in death I found my rank
Nine worlds below Nivlhel I went
That is where the dead of Hel's domain are sent
In a dream I saw a dark figure, a black cloak was hiding her face
My empty eyes stared insane with fright
By death would I now be embraced
I thought I had found a sanctuary, could a mind so empty go insane?
But one fear trod on the heels of another
I was dying again and again"

Something more besides you?

Their paths, their lives, their hearts.
If by chance one turns away
Are they forever lost?

The bed warm where it once was cold.
Small blessings laid upon us.
Small mysteries slowly unfold.
Yet I still wonder is there a point

Do I dare believe that there is

In a final death-throe
Vibrant as I thresh...

With six feet below
In harmony with the deceased

Shrieking out their recitals

It's all around, it's all consuming, a chasm, an abyss that sucks you in, be it active or passive, be it soldier or slave, the fog of war engulfs you all.
You've never seen rain like this before, had to cut the heels out of your boots just so the water could drain, so the blisters
could drain, as any compassion for humanity drains. At least when the rain falls it keeps the mosquitoes away, not much of a
trade-off really, fiendish things lusting for your blood while bullets sizzle through the air leaving a trail of mist as the
molten lead homes in on its pray. And that's you by the way, and you're caught up in the fog of war
It's a world beyond fear, you can't even see the enemy, although you're learning to sense them, sense the presence, smell the
adrenaline or the fear, because you know, that they know, that you know
And you'll never rest, not here, not now, possibly never, for this battle will rage on eternally (at least for some of you). And sure, the rain will stop eventually,
but the fog surrounds the soldier forever."

Sacrifice in homage to reject this mercy
Cruelty to consume the vitality beneath the flesh
Legacy of the funeral
Allow this body of the soulless to be raised as great gate
Channeling the chambers of blood to bring his rebirth
Shaping this myth within a lunatic's mind
No forgiveness attained
Alive within this altar of flesh
Forever to be this restraint in promised pain
Veins are emptied and embalmed with the appetite of betrayal
Speechless lips are removed to invoke the words of the dead
Infestation of belief that promised broken lies
These ties with the unholy came true before these eyes
Take these hands of betrayal and succumb to the defiance of death
Lying in the arms of the sick, kissing this seduction of spilling blood
The reality in promised faith now lies imprisoned in dark shrines
Breathing out these streams of blood, this horror grows inside
These fears await the butcher's knife
On wings of steel a soul will rise
Methods of enslaving of the absolute
For the degrading of eternity
Blessed in the grasp of desecrated rites
This fearless journey to resurrect
Upon countless years we've died
Etched scars in the skin of the attained
The lifeless reborn once again
Addiction in this infernal flame
Surface this unclean soul as mouths of the underworld speak through wounds
The regeneration of silenced pureness is strangled by intestines
In halls of the confined this silence dies
By avenging screams seeds of life cease
Amnesty in the corrupt
This black consumes the mind
The paleness of the eyes
This sight is content in submergence
Emerged from stripped flesh
Arise from the shell of god
Flood waters of the baptized engulfing life to give birth to the cold of hell
Self indulgence in the creation of perverse fear
Hands now made tools of surgery
Sinister ways of salvation
Dissection of this savior
Released from the calling of sighs
Succumb to this arrogance in these words that dominate
Blood runs beneath these eyes
Entrance to the skull we find sickness of life
Now march to the sounds of funeral cries"

My bags are all packed, you wont see me anymore.
The room it was empty except for your clothes
And a picture of the forest through the dimly lit smoke
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first one was lonesome and the second one was clear
The first one was familiar as the second drew near
She walked to the window to expose the light
Her breath hung in silence like the fog in the night
The sun raised its head from behind the frost
She sat down by the stove with her long legs crossed
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first one was ancient but the second was a gun
The first one was laughin before the second was done
She drew up her eyes and then turned my way
Her mouth it was movin but the words tried to stay
Her posture was thin and her tears they were tall
Like the picture of the forest in the fire in the hall
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first it was singing and the second dressed in red
The first one was hungry and the second was well fed
My struggles were hard and my journey was long
My food was your beauty and my water your song
I returned for your voice and your precious melody
I heard them both but you sang not for me
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first was a flower and the second was a train
The first issued warning and the second brought the rain
Day is breaking, its time for me to leave
Each breath I'm taking reminds me to grieve
You've proven false but another will be true
Walking tall in the darkness the whole night through
Will you sleep well?
Will you sleep fine?
Will you sleep much at all?
All night you'll hear two voices from out there in the hall
The first will be a mirror and the second one a dove
The first will be an echo and the second silent love
Will you sleep well?
Will you sleep fine?
Will you sleep much at all?
All night you'll hear two voices from out there in the hall
The first will be a mirror and the second one a dove
The first will be an echo and the second silent love"

But the words that come out
Are swollen with pain
She looks through my eyes
Right down to my soul
Sees all the hurt
That I can't control and she says
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but that's ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
Please daddy don't cry that way

of police sirens and flashing red lights. The villainous cat
Macavity is on the loose! The cats scatter, leaving an empty
stage.
Two off-stage giggles signal the entrance of Mungojerrie and
Rumpleteazer, a fun-loving, frolicking team of pranksters,
always getting in trouble with the family with whom they live.
SOLO:
Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were a notorious couple of cats
As knockabout clowns, quick change comedians
Tight-rope walkers and acrobats
They had an extensive reputation
Made their home in Victoria Grove
That was merely their center of operation
For they were incurable given to rove
If the area window was found ajar
And the basement looked like a field of war
If a tile or two came loose on the roof
Which presently ceased to be waterproof
If the drawers were pulled out from bedroom chests
And you couldn't find one of your winter vests
Or after supper one of the girls
Suddenly missed her Woolworth pearls
Then the family would say, ""It's that horrible cat!
It was Mungojerrie or Rumpleteazer!""
And most of the time they left it at that
Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer had an unusual gift of gab
They were highly efficient cat burglars
As well and remarkably smart at a smash and grab
They made their home in Victoria Grove
They had no regular occupation
They were plausible fellows who liked to engage
A friendly policeman in conversation
When the family assembled for Sunday dinner
Their minds made up that they wouldn't get thinner on
Argentine joint, potatoes and greens
Then the cook would appear from behind the scenes
And say in a voice that was broken with sorrow
""I'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow
The joint has gone from the oven like that!""
Then the family would say, ""It's that horrible cat!
It was Mungojerrie or Rumpleteazer!""
And most of the time they left it at that
Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer had a wonderful way
Of working together
And some of the time you would say it was luck
And some of the time you would say it was weather
They'd go through the house like a hurricane
And no sober person could take his oath
Was it Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer?
Or could you have sworn that it mightn't be both?
When you heard a dining room smash
Or up from the pantry there came a loud crash
Or down from the library came a loud ping
From a vase which was commonly said to be Ming
Then the family would say: ""Now which was which cat?
It was Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer
And there's nothing at all to be done about that!""
ALL:
Macavity!"

Scarred from the flames of hope, my mask is made of stone
I'm not invincible, but I want to believe
That you're convinceable, I pray that you will be
Take the word and pass it on, I'm tired of preaching
Take the angel from the thorns, untie the wings of gold
Until I'm in the right of way
All my words are spoken, all my words are spoken
All my words are spoken
In a stolen prayer
I dreamed of different times, and tried to find my way
Ooooh all the darkest lies, cloud my world today
I'm not unbreakable, although I might pretend
It's not unthinkable that I could feel again
Take the word and pass it on, I'm tired of preaching.

They've ploughed, they've sown, they've harrowed, thrown clods upon his head
Till these three men were satisfied John Barleycorn was dead

There's beer all in the barrel and brandy in the glass
But little Sir John, with his nut-brown bowl, proved the strongest man at last
They've let him lie for a long long time till the rains from heaven did fall
And little Sir John sprang up his head and so amazed them all
They've let him stand till midsummer's day and he looks both pale and wan
Then little Sir John's grown a long long beard and so become a man
[Chorus: x2]
They've hired men with the sharp-edged scythes to cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him around the waist, treated him most barbarously
They've hired men with the sharp-edged forks to prick him to the heart
And the loader has served him worse than that for he's bound him to the cart
So they've wheeled him around and around the field till they've come unto a barn
And here they've kept their solemn word concerning Barleycorn
They've hired men with the crab tree sticks to split him skin from bone
And the miller has served him worse than that for he's ground him between two stones

And the huntsman he can't hunt the fox nor loudly blow his horn
And the tinker he can't mend his pots without John Barleycorn"

Floatin' their faces on the wall like it's the last time.

I'm sure that over time I learned to right all of my wrongs.

Four walls reflectin' my life
Every night
That I sit and watch the replay.

And it's just too much to beat, I can't win.
Don't grin, it ain't funny I just set it ablaze

I was burned from my neck to my feet but it was worth it
Until I went back, I didn't even hurt.

One wall surrounds me, no roof no floor.
I started fallin' as soon as I stepped through the door.
Plain walls, don't let me see a crack in the paint
Or I'm focusing in, and focused I ain't.
Clang-bang, I bloody the walls and leave stains
So the next man falling at least can see thangs.
I think of my life relivin' every memory
Staring into the walls of my epitome.

Nothin' but walls, but it's alright.
My back to the room in the corner all night. (These walls keep watchin' me.)
Nothin' but walls, but it's alright.
My back to the room in the corner all night. (Even in the darkness.)
Nothin' but walls, but it's alright.
My back to the room in the corner all night.
[James Lowrey]
I always catch myself starin' into a dark daze,
Same place, new age, holes punched with rage.
If they could talk they probably wouldn't say much
Because I always keep myself locked away and such.
Just a sheltered life being wasted away
Like four walls on a casket being put in a grave.
So many hours spent looking at nothing,
But I keep on glaring, steady hoping for something.
[Chris Rouleau]
I stare in this maze through my cell gate.
For eighty years I been known as inmate 1-4-2-7-8.
Walls can't confine me, on the noose every weekend.
When the guards take me for my shock treatment,
I be leavin', out the space in my head
To control the minds and unearth the undead.
The problem is, I'm only out for two days
And I return to my coma and these walls and bars around me.
Surrounding me,
These walls ain't holding me back.
They can't tell me where we at.

Running too quickly to the finish line.
Time is a track that's ready and set
And the longer you live, the closer you get to being
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then they forget
There's no guarantees or promise of wealth
When you're only allowed so much time on the shelf
Time isn't money, it's only a lie
Because everything lost can be found but you're
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then they forget
But live in doubt, live in fear,
And you might live forever
Or live it up and watch your back
And you might live for better

Who cares for wealth or gold
Because I find a fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two arms that hold me tight
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
And when he lays his head
Upon his pillow so white
I pray the Lord above
To guide him safe through the night
In dreams I see his face
And feel his fond embrace
There's no one can replace
That little boy of mine."

You never thought I'd follow through
So here's a song for all of you
Reaction for attacking me and acting like I'm small to you
This is what you call the truth
It chews you up and swallows you
A fraction of the wrath in me unraveling for all to view
I'm glad you always hated me
Cuz that's what made me chase the dream
And now I'm here, so close, so near, and you're so far away to me
This is what you made me be
You'll always be the same to me
So full of fear, afraid to hear, me spit the truth so blatantly
Chorus:
You brought me down for the last time
It's the last time I shut my mouth
I'm screaming out from the inside
For the first time
It's the last time you bring me down
Verse 2:
It's funny that you think we're friends
It's maybe time to think again
The shit you said, you wished me dead, instead of trying to make amends.
Now it's finally sinking in
That I'm the one who's finishing
So don't pretend to take offense, you earned it every single cent
Almost thought that you were right
I almost thought I'd lose the fight
And came undone, you almost won, you almost conquered me with spite
You never saw it through the light
It blinded you it skewed your sight
The shit you talked, and what you thought, and now it fucking ends tonight
Verse 3 (Deuce):"

I'll see it all from back when there's time,

To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound it's loud tattoo
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew
And back through the glen
I rode again
And my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you
For slavery fled oh glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew"

Dass dunkle Mchte gekommen.
Beraubte Mnner taten kund,
Dass Feen zu mondlos schwarzer Stund'
Unschuldige Kinder nhmen.
Des Tales khnste Heldenkmpfer gingen
In vielen Jahren aus, die Feen zu zwingen;
Auf den Schilden mancher lichter Reim.
Doch keine jener silberweien Klingen
Kehrte jemals wieder heim.
Einen Jngling, der die Schauermr
Vernommen, zog die Neugier in
Der rauhen Waldesschatten grnes Meer,
Jener Schauermr zu folgen
Nach der Neugier, nicht der Rache Sinn.
Er durchstreifte Schattenschluchten,
Lichtbefleckte Bltterfluchten,
Weite Grnde,
Windbehauchte.
Wildgefurchte
Felsenbnde
Liess er schauernd hinter sich.
Auf einer kleinen Lichtung goldbeschienener Steine
Sorgsam gerundeter Kreis schweigend den Abend besah.
Eingefasst ward diese Runde von einem lockeren zweiten
Ring von rauherem Fels, wachsam von Bumen umkrnzt.
ber den schillernden Grsern, inmitten der steinernen Zirkel,
Zwang eine stille Magie alle Gerusche zur Ruh'.
In dieses Zentrum trat der Knabe
Mit Bedacht.
War's das Herz des Waldes?
Oder ward von dieser Warte aus
Die Gabe
Aller Schpfung ausgebracht?
Wie er noch dachte
Und das Schweigen ihn umschloss,
Schienen sich die Schattenschleusen
Rings umher im Kreis zu ffnen.
Es schwebte sachte
Engelsgleicher Geistertross
Durch die Steine zu ihm her.
Der Knabe stand und staunte
Ob der Mrchengeister,
Deren Kreis sich um ihn schloss,
Wie die Schler ihrem Meister
Lauschen, stand der Kreis und staunte.
Bald erklang im grnen Rund der Kronen
Heller Sang aus abendkhlem Grund;
Aus den Kehlen silberner Dmonen
Stieg die Melodie mit fremder Kund.
Die Stunden flogen nachtbehaucht davon,
Ein Feuerschwarm mit Lohenflgeln
Im Dunkel. Auf den waldbedeckten Hgeln
Im Irgendwo verglhten sie und starben.
Der Knabe, ganz in Tanz und Sang versunken,
Von der sanften, unerreichbar fremden
Schnheit ganz und gar verzaubert, hatte
Jeden Zweifel gegen dieses Volk verloren.
Bald tanzte auch der Knabe
In dem Feenreigen mit.
Manch tapf'rer Held im Grabe:
Vergessen mit jedem Schritt.
Du, nicht menschliche Gttin, silberweiss glnzende Schne,
Warum nhert Dein Blick sich einem Jngling wie mir?
Niemand der jemals vergleichbar solch Unvergleichliches sah,
Konnte, erblindet im Glck, von Deinen Augen sich wenden.
Liebliches Menschenkind,
Quell meiner glcklichsten Stunden,
Du musst diesen Ort vor dem Morgen verlassen,
Sonst wirst Du in Felsen gebannt
Wie alle anderen vor Dir.
Wenn Du nicht fliehst vor der ltesten Hand,
Wird dieser Stein Deine Seele umfassen;
Bis ans Ende der Zeit.
Der Knabe erschrak
Und der Zauber verblasste,
Die Seelen der Steine im Kreise
Erschienen vor ihm.
Sie schrieen,
Sprachlos
Auf abscheuliche Weise
Es schien
Als erschienen
Die Toten vor ihm.
Sie tanzten den Reigen
Auf lodernden Flammen,
In knisternden Lichtern.
Der Geistergesang
Ging seinen Gang,
Und die Feenmdchen tanzten
Im steinernen Ring,
Und die silbernen Locken
Wogten im Winde.
Der Knabe rannte
Zurck in den Wald.
Ins Dunkel der Schatten,
Dem Zauber davon.
Als der Morgen ber die Hnge zog,
Die zarte Rte das Dunkel bog,
Erreichte der Knabe das Tal.
Er blickte zurck
Als she sein Blick
Die Geister ein letztes Mal."

And though other cultures tried to destroy them, driven no doubt by their jealousy of the Celts' fine fashion sense and edible cuisine, they did not surrender. Actually, they surrendered quite often, but they were never entirely wiped out, clinging to the corners of small islands, their voices raised in song, the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens.

As in a cellar;
I look upon four dark walls.
While the sun smiles to others, but me.
Waterdrops penetrate the ceiling;
giving back to me,
the semblance I used to have.
Madness... Dream or truth?
Fascinating it was;
yet I was given another impression.
Unlike this one.
Please give me a hand, because it was damnation who brought me here.
The bricks turn to dirt, as the ceiling seems to be a bed of holcus
lanatus.
You are stale...
Have you buried what we have sworn to each other?
I'm your blood.
And you, yes you... You are my thought!
Come and free me from this garden of pain.

I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas

Isolated by the silent thoughts...
They were too strong for her mind...
Misguided by the burning desires...
She couldn't resist them at all...

Her fragile soul was hurt by the night too black...

Stumbling to some other house

The guilt of just a small mistake
To puncture the joy

Every Sunday morning, before daybreak
Down upon the farm, on the fishpond
All the little ducks, they go paddling
Look out goldfish your for breakfast
Sunday morning hear the churchbells ringing
High up in the trees the birds were singing In the dewey grass spiders spinning
Rooster calls and cocks his doodle
All around the farm animals stirring
Through the morning mist the bulls are beefing
In the grassy meadows cows are munching
Daisy Bell it's time for milking
There's such a lot to be done on the farm
In the sunshine, and when it's lunchtime
It's hop down the pub for a pint
Back on the tractor to finish the plowing
Standing all alone, Fred the scarecrow
Hasn't got a clue how the wheat grows
Doesn't mind the rain, hates the cold though
Specially when those icewinds blow snow
All along the lane, bees are buzzing
Little furry things in hedgerows scurrying
In amongst the corn the bunnies are bouncing
Must have springs upon their feet
Behind the cowshed
The plowman is taking a peek
At the farmer's daughter
Who's hanging her undies in the sun
Better get on your boots and join us
Down on the farm
Down here on the farm
It's a lovely day for country walking
The vicar's on his bike, Billy's skateboarding
The farmer and his dog out back shooting
The gun goes off and hits the tweeting (or: its stopped tweeting)
Lots of smelly stinks around the farmyard
Great big pile of sh..t behind the rhubarb
Sitting in his pram, baby bunting
Does a *BURP* and starts his grunting
Give him a drink, he's gone pink
Wants his mummy, needs changing I think
Such a lot can be done on the farm
In the sunshine
And when it's lunchtime
It's hop down the pub for a pint
Sneak out the backway with Nelly the barmaid
To the woods

called louis xiv was crowned child king
he ordered all the dukes and counts to his home
so he controlled their lives and made them docile and tame

louis xiv, finesse and force
he reigned over his nation, insuring his sovereignty
louis xiv, finesse and force
indeed there was the other side to louis xiv
he build splendid gardens to impress all his friends
for the aristocracy all gifts to him send
he showered his court with parties and fun
the reasons are many, he's the king of the sun
two generations later the king has succumbed
he lost all control, the country had gone numb
the realm was in an uproar, so something had to snap

the sinking of the empire wasn't to be changed
in the bloody vacuum it all felt so strange

I've talked to a bum out on sunset strip
He asked me how would you feel
If everybody acted like you didn't exist
You'd lose your grip
Probably eventually flip
So let it be known
The only reason that we do this
Is so you can pick it up
And just bang your head to it
While emcees fight to see who could be the commonest
We float overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Overseeing the game
Over being part of the same
Old thing it's all gonna change
In a hurricane of darkness and pain
In acidic rain and promises you won't do it again
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will
And say what you might
But dont ignore who it's for
At the end of the night

In the first of me downfall I put out the door,
And I straight made me way on for Carrick-on-Suir;
Going out by Rathronan 'twas late in the night
Going out the west gate for to view the gaslight
cho: Radley fal the diddle I
Radley fal the riddle airo.
There I met with a youth and unto him I said
""Would you kindly direct me to where I'll get a bed?""
It was then he directed me down to Cook's Lane,
To where old Dick Darby kept an old sleeping cage
There I put up and down 'til I found out the door,
And I cried, ""Must I then spend the night on the floor?""*
And the missus came out and these words to me said,
""If you give me three coppers I'll give you a bed.""
She took me upstairs and she put out the light,
And in less than five minutes I had to show fight.
In less than five more, sure the story was worse,
For the fleas came about me and brought me a curse.
All round me body they formed an arch,
And all round me body they played the dead march.
The bloody old major gave me such a nip
That he nearly had taken the use of me hip.
Now I'm going to me study, these lines to pen down,
And if any poor traveler should e'er come to town,
If any poor traveler [be knighted] (benighted?) like me,
Oh, beware of Dick Darby and the black cavalry.

A pearl in the nest of memories
Forever gone...departed by the minds of man
Scavengers, feeding on your mother's blood
Parasites of life, with my heart I condemn
your ignorant ways
Like the leaves of the high trees
I wither and fall,
Borne by autumnal winds
to my funeral hall
I'm all alone in the grip of the silent sadness
I have been told to honour life
and what therein I'll find
but if all I see is darkness,
let me die and wake up blind
As the gleaming blade before me,
singing lullabies of loss
Whispering ""Death is your redeemer
to the Paradise you've lost""
Mankind, evoker of inferno
Let me burn your honoured Crown of Creation
and dethrone you to ashes for aeons to come
Why should I stay here where I do not belong?
Of weakness burns my within...And empty shell
I've lost the way to the sanctity I need
I'll greet the dawn that brings no life,
no frail beams of sun to cleanse the black night
My mournful roam has ended
I hide in the shadows white binding my time,
sheltered from this world which disorderly rhyme
with the fury of damnation
Once I held in my hand the starlight of Eden
and the white sky lay open in a soul that was free
(But the years flew so fast as the shadows were cast
and I woke up one morning with no reason to be)
I'm all alone in the shade of the nameless
Sorrow
I'm all alone within a shadowfire of fear
Take me home to whence I came
Where I'll find light to feed my flame of life
Or my heart will die without a whisper of hope..."

And from behind the bushes peepin' saw the apple they was eatin'
And I swear that I'm the one that et the core

I showed Columbus to this happy land
And for Pharaoh's little kiddies I built all the pyramiddies

She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand
She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time
Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring
She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him
Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new
Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king
Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song"

There is a silent man in a tower
Mute in a blinded world
Yet words dance on virgin lips
Freezing the winds of blood
Clad in layers of darkest velvet
Drenched in the gloomy light of dawn
..All Black
And in his wait for the grand finale
Standing atop of the stairs
From dawn to dusk his heart's a blaze
Uncovering words from an obsolete state of mind
Sharpen them! Turn them into arrows!
Descend into grief - Without a bow no arrows fly
..Bitter Black
Passing through the ebony archways
Hand in hand with the wisdom of stars
Wisdom dressed in blackest array
There is no man in that tower
Walking the shores in black
Bitter frost now bite the walls of hope

RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
It was late and I was sleeping when he called
And I can't remember much he said at all
Just that he was leaving town and must get off the phone
I can't remember when he told me he'd be home
Did he say Sunday noon or one day soon
I think he left with them but what if he said am
Did they go to meet the train or leave to catch a plane
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
So I telephoned his house and asked his mom
If she'd knew where her little boy had gone
I know she must have told me and I heard her loud and clear
But I can't remember anything but tears
Did she say fishing trip or he gave you the slip
Is he off to see the world or to see antoher girl
Did she say he took the car or what a fool you are
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone"

So quiet but deadly
Burning deep within, and now he will begin

As you're taken down into his gravity
He wants you now, into his masterplan
And he'll be taking you into his dignity

And I'm way past the lowlands and the deserts of failure and doubt
And the last time I passed through satisfaction

""Excuse me mister, is that seat taken, can I put my bag over here
You know this trip would go a whole lot smoother
If you take your hand from there""
No, I'm not from around here and my name's not 'Little Darling'
Why is there one in every crowd and why do I attract them?
Funny how the smell of a greyhound bus now smells like a fresh start to me
And now the sound of the steel belts on the blacktop
Is now the sound of breaking free
But I'd trade all those canceled tickets for a single return fair to a station
With a loved one waiting there
I've finally learned that there's good and bad
And that a girl can do some choosing
Of that I'm glad 'cause this hardened face won't take any more bruising
Yeah, and the next time I fall into another's arms
There's one thing of which I'll be certain
That you can bear the weight of the love I give
Without considering it a burden
It's been a long time since I've seen the high planes of expectation
And I'm way past the lowlands and the deserts of failure and doubt

Jumping in the ocean.

A little more emotion!

Sometimes I wish that you had came
With your own set of directions.
I guess it's not that easy,
But I hope that you still love me anyway.

killed in battle. He will now take the ""low road"", or the spiritual road, back home to Scotland,
while Moira (his love) stays on the ""high road"" or the earthbound road.
This concept is based on a Celtic myth that stated
when a Scotsmen died in a foreign land, they took the low road back home.
They will never meet again in this life
but they will
some day meet again
far above the bonnie banks of Loch lomond.
O wither away my bonnie May(which direction) Sae late an' sae far in the gloamin' (so far) (Gloaming = dusk/twilight) The mist gathers grey o'er moorland and brae (hill) O wither sae far are ye roamin'?
Chorus:
O ye'll tak the high road an' I'll tak the low I'll be in Scotland afore ye For me and my true love will never meet again By the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond
I trusted my ain love last night in the broom (own) (bush) My Donald wha' loves me sae dearly For the morrow he will march for Edinburgh toon (town) Tae fecht for his King and Prince Charlie (to fight)
O well may I weep for yestreen in my sleep (yesterday), we stood bride and bridegroom together. But his arms and his breath were as cold as the death And his heart's blood ran red in the heather
(Chorus)
As dauntless in battle as tender in love He'd yield ne'er a foor toe the foeman (enemy) But never again frae the field o' the slain (from) Tae his Moira will he come by Loch Lomond
The thistle may bloom, the King hae his ain (have his own) And fond lovers may meet in the gloamin' And me and my true love will yet meet again Far above the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

Pernicious - A ghastly Gordian quandary to elucidate
Pestiferous - A nebulous necrotic novelty to navigate
Labyrinthine - A contumely carnal conundrum to cogitate
Serpentine - An exulcerated entanglement to execrate...
Hands stained and filthy from digging deep for the answer
That lies at the heart of the matter of splatter...
Eschatological - The grave matters with which we struggle
Pathological - The perverse perpetuation of this purulent puzzle
Repugnant - The wretched riddle unravels in a reeking revelation
Repulsive - The final fetid farce yields such a rancid realization
Now your morbid curiosity may finally be answered
Deep in the heart of the matter of splatter...
A morbid matter on which to meditate or mutilate
A deathly detail to deliberate and desiccate
A sombre study in which sagacity is tantamount to insanity
An insalubrious interest in the inhumed and the unsanitary...
An unhealthy pursuit of the purulent and parturient
A feculent fixation upon the fetid filth and excrement
An exhaustive examination of the excreted and the exhumed
A tireless appetite to hill the silt atop the tomb...
[Lead - Mike]
Nebulous - The sanguineous solution is seldom seen before the last
Amorphous - Seemingly always six deep feet beyond your grasp
Funereal - Carnal cartography to chart the course of life's denouement

Culled from the heart of the matter of splatter..."

I wanted to give you more than just my name
I wanted to buy you not wine but champagne and then came the hard years
Cause I started working harder and longer than ever before
Just to buy you all the things that you never even asked me for
And I never noticed but you changed more and more those were the sad years
But the price of success just kept goin' up
And even when I had it all I didn't want to stop
For some reason it became importanted to me to stay on the top

no more wondering pink or blue,
she gonna be a Little me and you,
now I have a mind for nursery rhymes,
old mother goose little Bo peep
call Dr Seuss to put her right to sleep
[Chorus]
There's only one other who can love this girl like me
The mother of the finest little pearl in any sea that is what she is to me
Go to sleep my darling sandman is calling,
where the stars are gleaming you will be dreaming
Go to sleep my darling sandman is calling,
we will be waiting for you love and adore you
Go to sleep my darling sandman is calling,
where the angels guide you to the dreams inside you
Go to sleep my darling sandman is calling,
holding all your moonbeam join me in my dreams
Thanks for your help anyway."

Cigarette smoke, drifting up
To hanging plants behind
Particles of honesty
And tenderness entwined
Things with you are different now
And I can feel the strain
What is it that protects you from this pain?

With the days that lie ahead me
I'm hungry to remain
Still, I know it's best to go
'Cause nothing's going to change
Eyes that held so much for me
Are holding things from me now
Like the harmonies
That life will not allow

I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would have forded the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a riding on the Tennessee Stud
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean mean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foal
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud
Well, I got as lonesome as a man can be
Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a dreaming of his sweetheart too
We loped right back across Arkansas
I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a riding on the Tennessee Mare
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean mean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and forded the flood
On the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
A little horse colt playing 'round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

Come bibbing down on him straight way

What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town

For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea.

Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee
Or I will give you a full cannon ball
Cannon ball, cannon ball
And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea
Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail
Nor bring our ship under your lee
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
Merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea
Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three
Till Henry Martin gave to them deathshot
The deathshot, the deathshot
And straight to the bottom went she

Bad news to fair London Town
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away

But if any one of us should interfere

Apparitions wail from the mould infested crypts
Skin begins to peel, turn to gelatin, and drip
Twisting roots imprison you, your coffin starts to rot
Bound to this dimension, though the chains you can see not
Timeless creeping horror, a nightmare with no end
The snails in your skull are your only earthly friends
Your brain begins to ooze with the secrets of the dead

You feel your eyeballs melting as you start to decompose
They burst inside the sockets and come running out your nose
Sacs of pus erupt in places better left unmentioned
Bloated bowels surrendering all powers of retention
Drooling fat congeals into pudding in your crypt
Beetles nest in ear canals and munch on waxy drips
Maggots feed on viscera, a swirling toxic stew
There's no one here to blame it on, that odor came from you
As your casket opens you see four hooded freaks
Laughter in the moonlight, horrifying shrieks
Two hundred years you've been rotting in this grave
And now you will awaken to become a willing slave

Replacing spinal fluid, sucking at our drool

Like the sky high above,

The woman that he loves,

Stalked the Norseman with his bow,
put an arrow through his heart.

Overcast upon our blindness playing the instruments of betrayal.

I saw a maid milking a cow

Left me quite unable to go
My heart, it was loaded with sorrow
For the pretty maid milking her cow
Then to her I made my advances
""good morrow most beautiful maid
Your beauty my heart so entrances""
""pray sir do not banter,"" she said
""i'm not such a rare precious jewel
That I should enamour you so

The indies afford no such jewel
So bright, so transparently clear

Or the wealth that gold mines can bestow
I'd rather be poor in a cottage
With the pretty girl milking her cow."

Tearing through flesh

Shaking the ground
Hacking and killing

A stab in the back

He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme

Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more I am tempted to say ninety-nine
And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall

Well, of all things, can it be really?
Yes, no, ho-hi-oh, my eye
My mind may be wandering, but I confess
I believe it is old Deuteronomy
Old Deuteronomy sits in the street
He sits in the high street on market day
The Bullocks may bellow, the sheep they may bleat
But the dogs and the herdsmen will turn them away
The cars and the lorries run over the curb
And the villagers put up a notice ""Road closed""
So that nothing untoward may chance to disturb
Deuteronomy's rest when he feels so disposed
The digestive repose of that felines gastronomy
Must never be broken whatever may befall

Dear mom was the way that it started I miss you so much it went on
Mom I didn't know that I love you so but I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench mom don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did when I was a kid and I'd come home with mud on my feet
(The captain just gave us our orders and mom we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get but now I'll just say I love you)
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darling had died
That night as she knelt by her bedside she prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free"

And now I am watching you follow her out the door
Of my house, and it feels so mean
I didnt know youd moved on to another heart
While I was picking mine up with its broken parts
I did it to him, you did it to me
Shell do it to you cause were 23 years old
And thats what we do when were 23
And I still remember watching you in November
Like a Hollywood movie on the silver screen
And you looked so good in 2-D
That I fell blindly for you like hed fallen for me
And I recognized the same look in your eye yesterday
As you watched her through your camera with the split-second delay
I did it to him, you did it to me
Youre next on the list cause shes 23 years old
And thats what we do when were 23
And I wouldnt take it back cause now I know more about me
But I shouldve had a laugh earlier cause its pretty silly
How we slide along the winning edge and the losing edge and the middle
And we dance around and poke ourselves on this love triangle
I did it to him, you did it to me
Shes doing it to you, we should start dating people that are 30 at least
Cause thats what we do when were 23 years old
And thats only half of the stupid stuff we do when were 23 years old

And spread evil to the earth that gave him birth
Once there was no crime, and no greedy selfish minds

Living by the rule, killing just for food
Keep the balance in control
We are the keepers of time, the guardians of life
We know everything that the future will bring
Earth wind and fire is what we control
A burning desire that lives in us all, Keepers of Time

It rode right beside him there in the front seat
He littered his new place with those same old heartaches
It felt right at home there with her memory
He took it to church with him three times a week
He took it to bed when he laid down to sleep
The weight of remembering just wore him down
The longer he carried her memory around
When she never came back, he gave up on Jesus
And he never darkened another church door
He took up with whiskey, and he took up with women
'Till one night he just couldn't take anymore

Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships

When she sighs it's the sigh of a sleeping tiger's stir
And when she cries it's a storm like the world has never heard
And when she lies you'll believe in every single word
Coz you can never tell
With an east end girl

And when they're kicking down the door she'll be there at your side
They'll never take her alive coz she's an east end girl
She's dangerous and beautiful and proud
With her feet on the ground and her head high in the clouds
And all it takes is one look through a late night party crowd
To put you under the spell
Of an east end girl

And she may move to the country or the coast
For the kids and the Volvo and the Sunday roast
But there's one thing her posh neighbours can never boast
Underneath her shell
She's an east end girl."

If you'll gather all around me, now, the story I will tell
For I've got a situation and begorrah and begob
I can whisper all the weekly wage of nineteen bob
'Tis twelve months come October since I left me native home
After helping them Killarney boys to bring the harvest down

I'm the gaffer of the squad that makes the hot asphalt

And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
The other night a copper comes and he says to me, McGuire
Would you kindly let me light me pipe down at your boiler fire?
And he planks himself right down in front, with hobnails up, till late
And says I, me decent man, you'd better go and find your bait
He ups and yells, I'm down on you, I'm up to all yer pranks
Don't I know you for a traitor from the Tipperary ranks?
Boys, I hit straight from the shoulder and I gave him such a belt
That I knocked him into the boiler full of hot asphalt

And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
We quickly dragged him out again and we threw him in the tub
And with soap and warm water we began to rub and scrub
But devil the thing, it hardened and it turned him hard as stone
And with every other rub, sure you could hear the copper groan
I'm thinking, says O'Reilly, that he's lookin' like old Nick
And burn me if I am not inclined to claim him with me pick
Now, says I, it would be easier to boil him till he melts
And to stir him nice and easy in the hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt

You may talk about yer sailor lads, ballad singers and the rest
Your shoemakers and your tailors but we please the ladies best
The only ones who know the way their flinty hearts to melt
Are the lads around the boiler making hot asphalt
With rubbing and with scrubbing, sure I caught me death of cold
For scientific purposes, me body it was sold
In the Kelvin grove museum, me boys, I'm hangin' in me pelt
As a monument to the Irish, making hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat

She stands before the mirror
Smiles at her reflection
Striking sexy poses in the glass
She paints her lips a brilliant red
Piles her hair high on her head
Struggles to replace a false eyelash
She powders up her face
Paints her cheeks to match her lips
She wears a dress cut low in the front
Fittin' tight around her hips
And there inside her room
She stands and gazes at herself
Where beauty lives in memory
She lives in fairy tales
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
She was a fairy princess once
And was by all adored
They say she was the fairest of them all
They called her Cinderella
And they say that every fella
Would gladly answer to her beck and call
So the story went
They tell of how this handsome prince
Stole her heart and wandered far away
He took her heart and took her mind
Now she has lost all track of time
Forty years has passed and still she waits singing
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
Meanwhile back inside her room
The shads are pulled it's half past noon
But in her mind why it's forty years ago
She recalls the beauty of their love
She remembers he was beautiful
And of course she always knew she was
And so the past unfolds
And all at once inside her mind
She sees him at the door
And as he's leading her away
She feels the room begin to sway
Where beauty lives in memory
She falls dead upon the floor
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore"

At this dying earth
There is nothing left for me
So what must occur

Embrace my tortured mind

Drift alone in deep space
Journey towards the burning sun
Back to where it all begun
I board my vessel
And head for the stars
Through this cosmic trail
I will travel so far
Enjoy the serenity
Here alone in space
This solar journey will
Take me back in time
To defy the ways of God
And all mankind
Returning to the ways
Of everlasting pain
Where chaos is the law
And blood falls like rain
Now approaching the sun
It's burning my skin
Blistering flesh appears
Final descent into the flames
Finally the end is here
I couldn't imagine
That the pain I will feel
Is worse than before
Exploding within
This journey complete
As I pierce through the core
There in front of me is my destiny
To invade the world
Of the holy trinity
To bring it down is my master plan
As the war begins I make my final stand
The time has come to burn this place
Annihilate the human race
Showing them that I am the way
The world never thought
It would see the day
Now that I come to this journey's end
My mission is completed with their death
Returning to a place that I call home
To suffer forever all alone"

When one disappears the other follows so quickly.
Certain species, races, beings are gifted, you see, with the power to rob us of either should they feel so inclined to bother.
The land is run by a man-made set of rules, described as Holy or patriotic tools. Ethics are invented although a consciousness is not. Adamant beliefs are highly protected and when challenged frequently emerge victorious.
You can't speak, think or feel. Severed wings never heal. So justifies the kill.
Wait out the winter under forced custody. The static cold feels more like home than this open-armed penitentiary and we embrace the comfort of lost liberty.
So fictile is identity without self-governance.
(They name the soul the important part)
That's why free thinkers feel so lost and desperate.
(But every species has a heart)
And I just witnessed my first death. I watched the last escaping breath. I just saw a life turn into death. For them to claim it doesn't count is reckless, blind ignorance.
A cry for help, silenced, I saw her go...
I don't know where, a frightened stare became a lifeless glare...
Suddenly she was no longer there with me although I'm there with her. I didn't quite know when it was okay to exhale...
The excuse making race decides that breaking their own laws applies, but taking any life is wrong. I feel the pain for one. Though you can stand, still learn, still ignore, the weight of knowledge cracks glass floors. Ink runs quickly, blood runs slow, so wait for the rain (red) waters to flood the snow.
Wait out the winter under forced custody. The static cold feels more like home than this open-armed penitentiary and we embrace the comfort of...
Disgrace yourself because you've caged yourself in. Destined path's a dead end. Eyes take snapshots from broken clocks. Motion slows to a sleep walk and senses shut down with the frost and all is ending...

One time when I's growin' up -- it was when I's a kid -- there was nothin' to do at home so I called up on a friend an' said ""Let's pack us a box lunch an' go down to the Nishnabotna an' go swimmin'. An' maybe look for some toads.""
My friend said he thought that's a good idea 'cause he didn't have nothin' to do either an' he was outta toads.
So we packed up our box lunches an' we started out a-walkin', an' we come to a big iron bridge which was five miles from town where we observed a big sign which says ""West Nishnabotna"". I says ""This here's the place, an', an' now if we could just find some toads an' go for a good swim, we could have fun all day doin' nothin', just loafin' around in the creek.""
We jumped into that dirty water an' I thought we might be able to swim in it, but we quickly discovered that we could not even begin to dog-paddle in it. Be, because right where we was, the Nishnabotna was only four-an'-a-half inches deep. So we wound up a-crawlin' along down on all fours in it, through the mud an' beer cans an' yucky things an' old pieces a' cars.
We went past a bunch a' fenders an' a couple a' Plymouth hubcaps, when we come to a place where we thought there might be some toads. When we was surprised by a farmer who told us to get on out of there an' to never come back or he'd call up the sheriff an' have us put into jail for the rest of our natural-born lives with nothin' to eat but bread an' water so we'd starve.
But time passes by real quickly when you're havin' fun, so we ran through the fenders and the mud to the bridge again.

Led into dark corners where no one can hear
Where what you say doesn't lead anywhere
But darker corners of your fear
There must be more to it than the pilgrim's hateful dream
Of love and peace
I know I've had that vision too
An old key and an old rusty chain of keys
A key that turns you your whole life long

(Album: The Colour of Dreams)
Hey Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better
So Ibrahim, can you tell me, why did you come here?
What dream were you chasing and what did you hope to find here?
Did you flee from your own native land because your life was in danger?
Or were the reasons much more mundane, just poverty and hunger?
Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour
You see Ibrahim, there's something I've been meaning to tell you
Being hungry and poor bestows no special status upon you
We won't send you back, if you can prove they'd imprison or kill you
But if you're just going back home to starve, I'm afraid we can't help you
You see Ibrahim, you've become a bit of a problem
This world's full of refugees fleeing poverty, war and oppression
So to take in queue-jumpers like you, well it's out of the question
It would give the world's hungry and poor the wrong impression
Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour
I'm afraid Ibrahim, it's time to be totally candid
You had Buckley's chance* right from the moment you landed
Already to many a threat and a danger you were branded
And all because you follow the prophet Mohammed
You didn't count Ibrahim, on political opportunism
Our leaders knew that to many Australians, the very word ""Muslim""
Meant Al-Quaeda, Hammas, the Taliban, and terrorism
And that's why you and your family are locked up in prison.
Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour
So Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better
Yes I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better

Outa the blue, the storm rolls in

Thunder strikes, but I will be
A place for you to hide

And you can't see, a star up in the sky
Let my voice anchor you
I promise the sun will rise

Sittin' on some Goodyears
Parked there in the drive way

Hanging from a cane pole
Laying in the trunk getting ready to go
In case we passed a hole we had to fish
Crack in the window

Had to duck his head

And the knobs are missing off the radio

First million dollars takes it home
The three on the tree was tough
My feet barely reached the clutch
But Daddy let me fire it up, back it out and pull it in

Sand in the seat where I found the pin that fell from her hair
The night that me and Becky lost it
Sixteen when I stole those keys

Raise your arms up to the sky, raise em high, raise em higher
If I had another day, if I could come, if I could stay
Id clip your wings and sand your fangs, you would never get away
Fifteen steps between the two floors in your house
I would count em in my mind while I was sitting on your couch
I would trade my hands to have that day again
If I wanted two stubs and one less friend
Im not waiting for the angels anymore
They were always there in front of me, shouldve seen them before
Theyre telling me tomorrow aint as bad as it seems
Especially since this is just a dream
Sometimes beauty does the trick of lust, of desire
Immortality is no more thick than something beautiful that lasts forever
Spend our whole lives in a race for nothing lasting
But the way you touch me it lasts
Two hundred steps between my car and the rock
That we sat on near the beach as we watched the bottles bob
I would trade my eyes to have that day again
If I wanted to be a blind old fool still lonely in the end
Im not waiting for the angels anymore
They were always there in front of me, shouldve seen them before
Theyre telling me tomorrow aint as bad as it seems
Especially since this is just a dream
Shhhh Can you hear them?
Shhhh be still, can you feel them?
Just let them find you, reach out your hand and let them guide you
Fifteen steps between you and me and we
I would walk them in my mind while I was watching your TV
And maybe I should say a little prayer for us both
But then again, maybe I wont
Im not waiting for the angels anymore
They were always there in front of me, shouldve seen them before
Theyre telling me tomorrow aint as bad as it seems
Especially since this is just a dream"

Here I come
They call me
A beast like none before
I suck the abscess of dead infants
I want some more
I Am Baby Killer
I kill pregnant sluts and whores!!
Splaying inside the womb
Red and wet I tear chunks from the pussy Red and wet mangled unborn baby
Eat the meat dripping from filthy...
Cumstained, blood-soaked, rotten cunt Infant skull exploding in my mouth
It's brain on the floor
I grab it's tongue and tear it out
Dead meat for me. I can't believe
How much this baby is bleeding
It's tiny stumps pours out more
Than it's dead mothers open sores
It's guts paint the floor
It's flesh I shall gorge.
It seems feasting on young infant flesh has made my semen leak.
I am aroused. Fuck I'm crazy
I fuck the blood. I need meat on my cock.
No meat can satisfy me. I must spew my seed
Spunk flows throughout the mangled infant. now I'll chop it up
Chunks of guts fly as i stand with baby skin all over me
Forcing the blood-soaked gore unmercifully down my throat
Pieces of baby are lodged inside of me
Over and over I feast on it's death
It's all gone. I want some more
I turn to it's mother
Blood is still flowing strongly from her butchered pussy
I drink from her fountain, stench of menstrual gore
Gagging on chunks of sliced up pussy
I feel pressure....
Pushing in my brain
The force caves in my head
My eyes eject slowly
Where's my knife?
I plunge my knife in
Inside my head
My veins are seeping
Warm streams of red
My tongue tastes so horrid
I must swallow it
Gore taste so scrumptious
Enough to wash it down with piss."

279595,"bal-sagoth","epilogue","XERXES:
Such devastation, master...
A mighty civilization destroyed in the blinking of an eye...
decimated by the madness of a rogue demi-god...
ALTARUS:
Indeed, my young apprentice.
Ancient Mu was annihilated utterly...
cast to the same shark-haunted grave as would
one day embrace Atlantis, Lemuria...
and even proud and noble Hyperborea.
XERXES:
And what became of the treacherous one...
the Chaos-dog Zurra?
ALTARUS:
He was consumed by his own darksome power, young Xerxes.
A splinter of his consciousness was returned to the
prison beneath the Mare Imbrium,
while another echo of his being was dispersed
along the filaments of the space-time matrix
to a period before the first battle in the War of the Lexicon was even fought.
The primary facet of the black-hearted Zurra was condemned
to a limbo of such unimaginable tortuous magnitude,
that it made the horrors endured by dread Angsaar himself
seem like naught but a lover's caress in comparison.
XERXES:
Such power as was wielded by Zurra corrupted his heart, master.
His quest for the Lexicon was not a desire
born of the eternal search for cosmic enlightenment,
but rather of a vain hope that such elucidation
would allow him to understand the horrors which blighted his own immortal soul...
ALTARUS:
You may yet one day understand
the intricacies of the sidereal web, young apprentice.
Come... the mists once again cloud the great cosmic eye,
and the vista darkens for today.
But rest assured, my youthful neophyte...
there are many more stories in this vast, eternal saga yet to be told..."

Twenty one, twenty two at the time
Yeah every place we go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars just for keeping
The ice cold, yeah we were legends and we still are
Two hundred fallen angels, we balling from every angle
Heavy bag gold, panamania changed angle

Human lifeform transformed from light storms, poltrons
Electrons nuetrons, iced long
Nights long, repltilaians I'll see ya'll in the next millennium
What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Caribbean
Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw

Many days and fewer nights... so I'm told.
I've lost my time years ago... so I'm told.
The explaining. The whispered words.
This will be the hardest part... so I'm told.
I wish my mind would work... unfold.
The explaining. The whispered words.
The front door opened to the look of death. Will this make sense? Will this be comforting at all?
The questions dive in day and night. Nothing we can do. Nothing I can do.
Twists and turns must be answered.
I hit land... so it seems
The dirt chokes up my legs... strong air then shoots down my throat.
Sensory overload in an instant of sense.
Charting through old water that I pushed away to drown.
Into another.
To find and be found.
This is what I've set out to do. Where is this door?
[Prospect #2]
The constant movement of my eyes. I can feel, but I can't open the lids. The back of my skin is scarred, torn and broken.
A reflection of what I've seen. (What have I become?)
They let these people recreate. Maybe I should have ended it all. Too late?
Moving forward is a must.
Dig deep.
Commence sleep inside sleep.
Silence.
(An out of focus picture brings up a familiar scenario: Three people fill the room.
There seems to be a fourth, but very small. We are speaking about some sort of
mission. My mouth won't stop moving... talking way too much. Even through the
blur I can feel their stares. This one sided discussion seems to be about what I am
preventing. Is this a sign? Too late... I've said it before. The people then disappear.
I look about and the western sky seems to be red... alone. I can smell burning
flesh... scorched life. I turn around and the face of death stares so grim that the
lids finally open...)
I come to.
I'm close... Very close. But something isn't right.
A horrifying realization is swept over me.
Home. The empty of home.
All I've known is gone. All I've loved is lost.

Come single belle and beau, to me now pay attention
And love, I'll plainly show, is the divil's own invention.
For once I fell in love with a damsel most bewitchin'
Miss Henrietta Bell, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen
cho:
To my toora loora la, my toora loora laddy
Ri toora loora la, ri toora loora laddy.
At the age of seventeen, I was 'prenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green, where Miss Bell for tea would go, sir
Her manners were so free, she set me heart a-twitchin'
She invited me to tea, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen.
Next Sunday bein' the day we were to have the flare-up
I dressed myself quite gay, an' I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The Captain had no wife, he had gone out a-fishin'
So we kicked up high life, below-stairs in the kitchen.
Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table
She served me tea and cakes --- I ate while I was able,
I ate cakes, drank punch and tea, till my side had got a stitch in
And the hours flew quick away, while coortin' in the kitchen.
With my arms around her waist, I kissed ---she hinted marriage
To the door in dreadful haste came Captain Kelly's carriage!
Her looks told me full well that moment she was wishin'
That I'd get out to Hell, or somewhere far from the kitchen.
She flew up off my knees, full seven feet or higher
And over heads and heels, threw me slap into the fire
My new Repealers coat, that I'd bought from Mrs. Stichen
With a thirty-shilling note, went to blazes in the kitchen.
I grieved to see my duds, all besmeared with smoke and ashes
When a tub of dirty suds, right in my face she dashes.
As I lay on the floor, still the water she kept pitchin'
Till the footman broke the door, and marched into the kitchen.
When the Captain came downstairs, and seen my situation
In spite of all my prayers I was marched off to the station
For me they'd take no bail, tho' to get home I was itchin'
And I had to tell the tale of how I got in the kitchen.
I said she did invite me, but she gave a flat denial
For assault she did indict me, and I was sent for trial.
She swore I robbed the house, in spite of all her screechin'
And I got six months hard, for my coortin' in the kitchen.

And nursin' the baby that's none of my own.

But for my misfortune, sure I was mistaken
She's proved both a curse and a plague on my life.
She goes out every night to a ball or a party
And leaves me here rockin' he cradle alone.
The innocent laddie he calls me his daddy
But little he knows that he's none of my own.
Now come all ye young men that's inclined to get married
Take my advice and let the women alone.

They'll leave you with a baby that's none of your own.

And he asked him gently, where do you belong

Love's become an open fumace,my follies stoked the fireplace
Blind to the peril around me,my resistance wearing thin
I fell prey to the power of temptation,and the brand of infidelity kissed
My skin
With each kiss a heart breaking,with a touch her love dies for me
Slowly desintegrates
Blackned by coals of deception,I cry for redemption far too late
Here today, gone tomorrow
Trail of tears leads to sorrow
Leads to sorrow
Alone I wallow in my suffering
So much regret behind my stare
Is love lost or just misplaced?
Can a heart broken be repaired?
With each thought conscience burning,with a sign her love dies for me
Cannot exonerate
Eyes filled with discontent,I plead for forgiveness far too late
Here today, gone tomorrow
Trail of tears leads to sorrow
No reprieve,despite your wishing
Trust betrayed,now she's missing
Her image you cannot replace
Missing,you hope to reconcile,but you've lost face
With each day soul searching,with the night I cry
""Restore me,reverse this morose state
Never again shall I falter,afford me this one mistake""
Fear today,loathe tomorrow
Trail of Tears leads to sorrow
Dream of when you were kissing
So aware of what you're missing

I told you that Broadway was waiting for me.
You were handsome and pretty, queen of New York city
When the band finished playing, the crowd howled for more
Sinatra was swinging, and the crowd they were singing
We kissed on the corner and danced round the floor.

There's always room here for the lonely

Dance in and out of the beams

Running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes I see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many years
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart

He was mowing his yard

And she waved from her front porch screen
And she went back to reading her two dollar novel
And playing with her wedding ring
A few houses needed painting
A few gates were unhinged
But generally the place looked the same
The driveways were full of bikes and Buick sedans
Things any good American would claim
And all them other lovers
That married for cover
They were out for the sacred nightly stroll
They were wishing they were characters in two dollar novels
Wishing for their weight in gold

She became a nurse
And I became a memory to them
And all my other buddies

And they ran off and served their country well
They're all fighting in a war of two dollar novels
Where only the toughest live to tell
So I turned right on white oak, left on first
Out of that old neighborhood
I left Doctor and Mrs. Randolph
Sipping iced tea on their sun porch
Wondering if I'd ever come to any good
And on a thousand shady streets
And in a thousand other towns
Now people, Lord, they're doing just the same

From that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree
And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city, wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Inisfree
I wander o'er green hills through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land would know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf fire, gathered
On bended knees, their rosary is told
But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality
But though they pave the footways here with gold dust
I still would choose my Isle of Inisfree"

Voll von wundenleckendem Licht,
Umgeben von Grausamkeiten names Menschen -
Keinen Tropfen Blut wert.

Vor langer Zeit,
Aber der immerwhrende Ha band meinen Krper
An diese Dimension.
Ich wandere rastlos und leer,
Auf der Suche nach Erlsung und Harmonie,
Wissend, da diese Suche sinnlos ist, endlos.
Jemand hatte die Macht -
Und raubte mir die letzte Hoffnung,
Den Mut diesen Schmerz zu beenden, mein Leben.
Mein Wunsch knnte erfllt werden -
Hinwegschwinden, sanft und sicher,
Auf Winterflgeln in die letzte
Und ewige Dunkelheit,
In der Eiswinde durch mein Haar streifen.

The flames of hell are nothing
Compared to this life,
Full of woundlicking light,
Surrounded by atrocities called humans -
Not worth a drop of blood.
My soul left this world
A long time ago,
But the everlasting hate bound my body
to this dimension.
I wander restless and empty,
Seeking deliverance and harmony,
Knowing that this search has no use, endless.
Someone had the power -
And robbed the last hope from me,
The courage to end this misery, my life.
My wish could be fulfilled -
Fade away, softly and certain,
On winterwings in the last
And eternal darkness,
In the icewind blow through my hair."

Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
Nothing matter Mary when your free,
Against the Famine and the Crown
I rebelled they ran me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely harbor wall
She watched the last star falling
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry."

Will ever drive again
But I know that this was not the end
Road warriors die hard
And I signed Mister Iacocca's
Organ donor card
The steel will get recycled
And they'll build another car
Bigger, faster, stronger
An automotive star
My quest will then begin
And revenge will soon be mine
As I drive my gleaming three-door
Orange Chrysler Frankenstein
Searching for that Buick
To try to end its days
We'll settle up that score
And then we'll drive away (The sun will rise again on the)
Horizon!
My Horizon!
My Horizon!"

Your eyes tell of lost love
your tears tell of your pain
I tremble as we kiss
as we embrace our passion
Darkness soothes a hungry soul
and in the twilight I dream
in the darkness we dance
this moment shall never end
I caress your delicate skin
melting into black silhouettes
I embrace thee my beloved
a moment I can not bare to end
In the darkness we dance
as the candles flame dies
our pain fills my heart
the sorrow of our last embrace. . .
Darkness soothes a hungry soul
and in the twilight I dream
in the darkness we dance
this moment shall never end"

Fools at love - they're all the same
Too proud to say they're wrong
Too proud and then they're gone
And who was I to think I'd change at all
I've always been alone
And bet I often freedom and not a prisoner to the cause
And all my pain was by my own hands
The one who thought that love could last forever
Guess I should have checked my record
'Cause now I see that love is not blind
It just stands frozen watching from behind"

302795,"dubliners","the rebel","I am come of the seed of the people, the people that sorrow;
Who have no treasure but hope,
No riches laid up but a memory of an ancient glory
My mother bore me in bondage, in bondage my mother was born,
I am of the blood of serfs;
The children with whom I have played, the men and women with whom I have eaten
Have had masters over them, have been under the lash of masters,
and though gentle, have served churls.
The hands that have touched mine,
the dear hands whose touch Is familiar to me
Have worn shameful manacles, have been bitten at the wrist by manacles,
have grown hard with the manacles and the task-work of strangers.
I am flesh of the flesh of these lowly, I am bone of their bone I that have never submitted;
I that have a soul greater than the souls of my people's masters,
I that have vision and prophecy, and the gift of fiery speech,
I that have spoken with God on the top of his holy hill.
And because I am of the people, I understand the people,
I am sorrowful with their sorrow, I am hungry with their desire;
My heart is heavy with the grief of mothers,
My eyes have been wet with the tears of children,
I have yearned with old wistful men,
And laughed and cursed with young men;
Their shame is my shame, and I have reddened for it
Reddened for that they have served, they who should be free
Reddened for that they have gone in want, while others have been full,
Reddened for that they have walked in fear of lawyers and their jailors.
With their Writs of Summons and their handcuffs,
Men mean and cruel.
I could have borne stripes on my body
Rather than this shame of my people.
And now I speak, being full of vision:
I speak to my people, and I speak in my people's name to
The masters of my people:
I say to my people that they are holy,
That they are august despite their chains.
That they are greater than those that hold them
And stronger and purer,
That they have but need of courage, and to call on the name of their God,
God the unforgetting, the dear God who loves the people
For whom he died naked, suffering shame.
And I say to my people's masters: Beware
Beware of the thing that is coming, beware of the risen people
Who shall take what ye would not give.
Did ye think to conquer the people, or that law is stronger than life,
And than men's desire to be free?
We will try it out with you ye that have harried and held,
Ye that have bullied and bribed.
Tyrants... hypocrites... liars!"

Raised the rifle to my eye, never stopped to wonder why

Sometimes time is all you need
Sometimes a little too much makes you
a little too sad
Brings you right to your knees
Sometimes its just a game
Sometimes it seems a dream
Sometimes its all the same its just the card you choose to play
Depending on the deal
This love is real, this love is rare
Thats how I feel you can say what you want
I dont even care
Love can be strange made of paper and steel
This love could change our lives Cause this love is real
Sometimes you get too close
In just a few short days
And its just the telephone that keeps
your tender heart afloat
When hes so far away
Sometimes you hold your tongue
To hide whats in your heart
Sometimes youve got to let him go the one you think you love the most
Though it tears you apart
This love is real, this love is rare
Thats how I feel you can talk behind my back I dont even care
Love can be strange frayed at the seams
But this love could change our lives Cause this love is real
Love can be strange like a difficult dream
But this love could change our lives Cause
this love is real
Sometimes love is not enough
Sometimes time is all you need"

Pretty young creature, she sat on the grass
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her
Ruffles and laces and a white fluffy duck
She said she was learning a new way to
Bring up her children so they would not spit
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling
Refuse and litter from yesterday's hunt
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her
Eyes at the fellow down by the dock
He looked like a man with a sizable
Home in the country, with a big fence out front
If he asked her politely she'd show him her
Little pet dog who was subject to fits
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her
Small tender hands with a movement so quick
And then she'd bend over and suck on his
Candy so tasty, made of butterscotch
And then he'd spread whipped cream all over her
Cookies that she had left out on her shelf

Something that you've always known

Waiting for the world to spin around
Just to survive
But when you see the morning sun
Burning through a silver mist
Don't you want to thank someone?
Don't you want to thank someone for this?
Don't you ever wonder why
In spite of all that's wrong here
There's still so much that goes so right
And beauty abounds?
'Cause sometimes when you walk outside
The air is full of song here
The thunder rolls and the baby sighs
And the rain comes down
And when you see the spring has come
And it warms you like a mother's kiss
Don't you want to thank someone?
Don't you want to thank someone for this?
I used to be a little boy
As golden as a sunrise
Breaking over Illinois
When the corn was tall
Yeah, but every little boy grows up
And he's haunted by the heart that died
Longing for the world that was
Before the Fall
Oh, but then forgiveness comes
A grace that I cannot resist
And I just want to thank someone
I just want to thank someone for this
Now I can see the world is charged
It's glimmering with promises
Written in a script of stars
Dripping from prophets' lips
But still, my thirst is never slaked
I am hounded by a restlessness
Eaten by this endless ache
But still I will give thanks for this
'Cause I can see it in the seas of wheat
I can feel it when the horses run
It's howling in the snowy peaks
It's blazing in the midnight sun
Just behind a veil of wind
A million angels waiting in the wings
A swirling storm of cherubim
Making ready for the Reckoning
Oh, how long, how long?
Oh, sing on, sing on
And when the world is new again
And the children of the King
Are ancient in their youth again
Maybe it's a better thing
A better thing
To be more than merely innocent
But to be broken then redeemed by love
Maybe this old world is bent
But it's waking up
And I'm waking up
'Cause I can hear the voice of one
He's crying in the wilderness
""Make ready for the Kingdom Come""
Don't you want to thank someone for this?
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Come back soon"

tonight will bring. The somber shade of star lite sky.
It begins when I close my eyes. Awaken from sleeping
visions. Waken no hours hope forlorn. All I can do,
all I can scream. Try to awaken from this dream.
Dreams of the past possessed my soul. Haunting
nightmares takes control. The screams and cried that
burns within. Laughing sirens on the wind. Reality
obscure by dreams. I feel death close by. Will I die
before I awake. Severe me from my dreams. I lie in
wait for daylight. Trapped by the silence that
surrounds me. Listen to as the night creatures call.
Weakness has profound me. Its all I can do, cant stay
awaked stimulate, lie down take my fate. Disturbed,
darkness descents around me. Close my eyes let it
begin again. Dreams of the past possessed my soul.
Haunting visions take control. Who will hear theses
screams within. Like whispering sirens on the wind.
Reality obscure my dreams. I feel death close by. Will
I die before I awake. Severe me from my dreams."

the town that I have loved so well
where our school played ball by the gasyard wall
and we laughed through the smoke and the smell.
Going home in the rain running up the dark lane
past the jail and down behind the fountain
Those were happy days in so many many ways
in the town I loved so well.
In the early morning the shirt-factory horn
called women from Craigeen the Moor and the Bog
while the man on the dole played the mother`s role
fed the children and then trained the dogs.
And when times got tough there was just about enough
but they saw it through without complaining
for deep inside was a burning pride
for the town I loved so well.
There was music there in the Derry air
like a language that we all could understand
I remember the day when I earned my first pay
as I played in the small pick-up band.
There I spent my youth and to tell you the truth
I was sad to leave it all behind me
for I`d learned `bout life and I`ve found me a wife
in the town I loved so well.
But when I returned how my eyes have burned
to see how a town could be brought ti its knees
by the armored cars and the bombed-out bars
and the gas that hangs on to every breeze.
Now the army`s installed by that old gasyard wall
and the damned barbwire gets high and higher
with their tanks and their guns, oh my god what have they done
to the town I loved so well."

All decked out and made up for TV,
Askin' for some money from God's people:
Talking all that high theology.
Well, I might be just an old blue collar:
There's things about the Lord that I don't know.
But I bet he never had a million dollars,
Or wore a lot of stylish fancy clothes.
'Cause Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.
Swimmin' in the river, fishin' for his dinner,
Livin' with the sinners like me.
Makes me think, Jesus was a country boy.
My Daddy never cared much for religion,
And my Mama worried a lot about his soul.
She'd hit her knees and pray for him on Sunday,
While Daddy hit his favorite fishin' hole.
You see, Daddy was a rebel and a rambler,
But I always knew he loved my Mama so.
An' I never doubted he'd make it to Heaven,
'Cause it ain't who you are, it's who you know.
An' Daddy knew: that Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.
Swimmin' in the river, fishin' for his dinner,

Shining in the the East, beyond them far,
And to the Earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

And I'm the sound of the bells you follow
But in this world dreams don't come true
Still when you're lost out in the desert
When your fire's a dying ember

Will be the light l shed for you

I see exactly where you are love
And no one else could shine that far love
To bring you safely through
And though you say you do not want me
And made no promises to haunt me

But when we heard that he was dead
We just could not understand

There was fear in every home
When late at night, a car came
Prowling 'round the Ryan Road
A Catholic would be killed tonight
To even up the score
Oh Christ, it's young Macdonald
They have taken from the door
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
Isaac was my friend, he cried
He begged them with his tears
But centuries of hatred
Have ears that do not hear
An eye for an eye
That was all that filled their minds
And another eye for another eye
Till everyone was blind
Now I don't know where the moral is
Or where the song should end
But I wonder just how many wars
Are fought between good friends
And those who give the orders
Are not the ones to die
It's Scott and young Macdonald
And the likes of you and I
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together"

Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis Island and they let
The people through.
And the first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.
[Chorus]
Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.
In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years
[Chorus]
When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

I barely feel your fingertips
Across my skin and on my lips
The feeling that you are close to me
Makes me shiver, makes me weep
[Chorus]
No one is more than you
Nothing compares to you
If you give my love away
You'd better know the game you play
'Cause my heart will loose a home
If you will go

I wish this night to last forever
And we could always be together
But by the dawn you'll be gone
And once more I'll be left all alone
Before you go my precious one
My only love, my brightest sun

Please come back tomorrow night

Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest
It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright

But yet the worst part lies ahead
When we will fight for our world

Translation
I went into a tavern, and the barkeep,
Doesn't much care for the look of me.
I look like I've got no money on me.
She tells me to hit the road.
I put my hand into my pocket,
I asked if she could break a shilling.
She said to me ""sit down at the table,
You'll be drinking here 'till morning.""
She roused the man of the house,
Tells him to get up, put his trousers and hat on,
And go out and find a musician to entertain me,
So I'll stay here drinking until morning.
Was I the man without sense
To leave my money when I'd been scorned?
I left woefully,
I left a sign to other people."

The singer, a black barbie doll
But it was well light, and well managed
Said our property, would be damaged
Until his boredom, took full advantage
Of it all
Talk to a girl, with klonopin eyes
Who said she had jewelry to sell
First he said no thanks, then he realized
That he realized he wasn't feeling that well
And he took what she held looked like pieces of sky
And a garnet like teardrops from hell
She offered, him a necklace, and he wanted to accept it
But it would end up, too expensive, he could tell
Then she said:
""Why not, what have you got, to lose, to lose""
When he never came back, and the curve you have pathed
His friends searched the fair grounds for clues
But security guard the maniacal laugh
Said its always the leader you lose
And he finally turned up in the broad light of day
With a black eye as big as the moon
They all asked him, what had happened
Was it real or, imagined
Why on earth had, he abandon them so soon
And he said:
""Why not, I do what I've got, to do, its what you do"""

Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you

And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

To comfort us hereafter all in America

We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower

I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
I'd like to know you and what you're all about
Hey could I have your autograph
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that
You may not be famous but you look like a star
You should be in movies as cute as you are
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps
Hey could I have your autograph
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds
And you're everything every girl dreams about
And being with you would be heaven no doubt
What I wouldn't do for your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Hey could I have your autograph
I like your body could I help you work it out
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph
Hey could I have your autograph

Would you take a chance on a girl from the South
Could I have your autograph"

In coldness of my dark bowel
a yell after mercilessness
bequeaths a trace of eternal destruction
to my decency
Uneven throbbing shadowfire
streams with raised melancholy
through twisted channels
of my forbode grief
In the black storms
of my mental agony
the deliverance ripens
in form of a godless dusk
The faceless ancient
grasps with stony miming
into the cradle of mercy
and severs the blood stained flag
But still it seems to me
that the lightbringer
spreads a shining shroud
over the shadow being
of an owl which died in chains
As the rock in me bursts asunder
the round dance of the colouring
grows up in my twilight"

Hear the voice that whispers near
Explore the inner strength within you now

Join us - in this quest to satisfy

Words I repent
Voice from inner self shall lead my way
Former ways of life I repent
To inner consciosness I've ascent

Key to the secret it beholds
Come to seek the path with me
In unfathomable harmony
The way life is meant to be
Enjoy and just adore life...
Burning desire in thee
Letting your soul fly free
No sould shall be the same
Burn with a different flame
Sowing the seeds of man
Proving the things your can
Seeing the things that'll be
The priors in life I can see
Each of mankind is a star
That will keep on shining eternally
Unveil the hidden unknown things in mind
Enchanted over things that you will find
Join us - in this quest to satisfy
Join us - and none shall mortify
I've seen the light unfurled by dawn
I've seen the blackest ways we scorn
We shan't conform - we shall remain...
In affection we loom - a reflection of time
Walless prison, consumed - ignore irrelevance (a rule)
Search the inner self - find the self within
Finding things I've seen in dreams (seeing evermore)
Things that' s left unsaid
Surrending to this inner force, feeling no remorse
Nothing to forbid
In the empty eyes of the last of mortals
Those songs they echo as in halls of the enlightened
Before this dawn of eternal light we stand
Once more now as darkness belongs to the forgotten
...to the forgotten
Internal sadness cured through the light
To reach the sadest river in sight
Whispers of molten souls in my ear
On wings of twillight I am born....
Now enthrone thoughts of the past
The embryo of time
Your life lies yet unfolded
'til enlightened ways we see
In my dreams I've seen repention
As in tales that were never told
Join us - in this quest to satisfy
Join us - and none shall mortify

And a wasted groom.
Maybe there's an angel
Laughing at us now
Trying to tell us something
That we should've learned
We should have learned
Are you listening to me now?
I used to have this dream you know,
But I let it slip away,
Traded it for something
I knew I could have
But never really wanted
Are you listening to me now?
I wish I could say something
Instead of sitting here numb
I wish my mind, I wish my mind
Was not such a loaded gun
I wish I was a stranger
Sitting in this room
Our eyes could meet each other's

But now it's too late for all that."

Passin' trains what ain't got no names
Switch yards full a' old black men
And the graveyards full of them rusted automobiles

Feel them wheels rumblin' under that floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers

On the high and lofty trestles
Near the fabled mines of Ophir

Now on my scale there ain't no ten's, you know
Nine is about as far as any chick can go
So I flashed her a smile, but she didn't even look at me
So for brains and good judgement, I'd give her a three.
I said, ""Hey sweet thing, you look like a possible eight
You and me could, uh! make eighteen, if your head's on straight.""
She looked up and down my perfect frame
And said these words that burned into my perfect brain.
She said, well, another one of those macho-matician men
Kind who grade all women on scales of one to ten
And, you give me an eight, well, that's a generous thing to do
Now, let's just see, just how much I give you.

Your style makes me smile, I give it a five
When you walked up I noticed that suit of (yores)
It's last year's double-knit frayed-cuffs, give it a four.
That must be your car parked out on the curb
That sixty-nine homemade convertible, a three and a third
Now, as for your build, I guess (yore) less than five
Except, for your pot belly, I'd give that a ten for size.
That wine you're pourin' might be fine to you
But I'm used to fine champagne, I give it a two
It's hard to tell what your flashin' smile is worth
I give it a six, you could use some dental work.
But, It's your struttin' rooster act that really makes me laugh
It may be a ten to these country hens, but to me a three and a half
And there really ain't much to add once the subtractin's done
Since there ain't no zeroes, I give you a one!.
She walked out, while up and down the line
The whole bar was laughin', said' Bare, what happened to your nine
Nine says I, hell soon as she started to talk I knew
She didn't have no class, I barely gave her a two.

seeking pleasure delivered with a price,

Toyed with what immediately only

Steel driven into skin. Contamination forced in.
Jaws of death close together. The haze that surges must not win.
Wither. Body given to the vortex, awake in a synthetic

Who wander out on a moonlit night with your dog, your gun and snare,
The hare and lofty pheasant you have at your command,
Not thinking of your long career spend on Van Dieman's land.
Poor Thomas Brown from Nenagh town, John Murphy and Poor Joe,
Where three determined poachers, the country well does know,
By the keepers of the land, one night, at last they were trepanned,
And for fourteen years transported unto Van Dieman's Land.
The first day that we landed upon that fatal shore,
The planters gathered around us, they might be twenty score,
They ranked us off like horses and sold us out of hand,
They yoked us to a plough, brave boys, to plough Van Dieman's Land.
Often when I slumber, I have a pleasant dream,
I 'm lying on the cold green grass down by your purling stream,
Oh, wondering through the maid of fair with my sweetheart by the hand,
Then I awaken broken-hearted upon Van Dieman's Land."

Like a bolting herd they came from the gates of hell
All baptised in the Devil's name to serve under his bell
In the wind you hear them scream ""Time to feed the sword!""
Blood now flows in an endless stream to praise and honour their lord
Pre Chorus
You never know when they attack,
until you fall with a sword in your back
Soldiers of death appear in your last breath
And there will be no time to fight
'cause you're already the target in their sight
Now hear them shout!
Chorus
We are the great Knights of Prey
We were born to slay and spread terror over the world
See us ride together as one, with mercy to none
'cause we are the great Knights of Prey,
and we are out of control
There's no place where you can hide, there's no use to flee
Through the cities, side by side comes your cruel destiny
Only a few chosen men can defend mankind
Will we ever be free again and get peace in our minds

And on these daybreaks of my life
Kept closed my eyes for seconds more.
When dreams freeflow the bending mind
Of all the grief and fear be gone.
And on these daybreaks of your life
Just close your eyes and live within
Oh let them flow and bend your mind
Try to believe the fear is gone.
Start piercing me you wicked ghosts!
Your voices sneak from red-rubbed lips!
Those tangling whispers - want to soothe me,
But start what I've never dared to speak of.
As slowly as I dropped the cape
- the slumber sweet as velvet fell -
I saw the smiling face of a day
that blew away my ease at once.
Not love not happiness I dreamed of
No hope for this so rotten live?
How can I tame? How can I hide
This twisted me I cannot fight?
Not love not happieness you dreamed of
Lose hope for your so rotten live.
You cannot tame, just try to hide

-Eric Bogle
In the summer of last year, in a city* far from here
That stands on the shores of the fair Pacific sea
I walked it's pleasant streets, no view in mind, no one to meet
Content to wander where my aimless feet led me
A few streets from my hotel, I passed an old stone wall
where three words had been scrawled by an unknown hand
When I read them I stopped dead, in disbelief I shook my head
For the words on that wall read, ""Free Bobby Sands""
As the sun began to fall, and the day began to die
Thought I heard the wild geese call, from a dark and empty sky
For long minutes I stood there, in that busy thoroughfare
While the past rose sharp and clear in my mind's eye
I saw it all again, the passion, hate, and pain
the indifference and the shame as a young man died
But it was all so long ago, and who now cares or knows
why Bobby Sands chose his lonely death?
But to the one who wrote that sign,
it seems that Bobby's light still shines
The words rang from another time,
but the paint was fresh
As the sun began to fall, and the day began to die
Thought I heard the wild geese call, from a dark and empty sky
So I went down to the sea, to let it's wild song comfort me
But my thoughts would not let me be, and unchecked they ran
Through my future, present, and past,
not for the first time nor the last
I heard them ask, ""Could you be the kind of man
who would gladly sacrifice everything, even life
and put no price on a cause, or an ideal?""
No answer echoed in my heart, so I turned and I walked back
through the twilight's deepening dark, to my hotel.
****************
Historical Note:
Bobby Sands, MP, was imprisoned in 1981 under criminal charges
stemming from his alleged involvement in IRA terrorist activities
in Ulster Province (Northern Ireland). Mr. Sands, along with
20 other alleged IRA members in prison awaiting trial, went
on a hunger strike to protest inhumane conditions in the prison, and to
have the IRA members reclassified as ""political prisoners"".
The hunger strike lasted more than 60 days, resulting in the deaths
of many of the prisoners, of which Mr. Sands was the first to succumb.

The hopeful possibilities
Have come and gone away
We've both run out of reasons to stay
Who we are and who we thought we were has somehow changed
We kept trying anyway
It's just not gonna work
It's just not gonna fly
We've been frozen on the edge
Staring at good-bye
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories, shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true
I never thought I'd do
My dreaming without you
You'll go one way, I'll go mine
And take some awkward steps
Almost free except for these regrets
Moving one's the only thing that we have left to do
No one can say we didn't see this through
But...
Repeat Chorus
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories, shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true
I never thought I'd do
My dreaming without you"

I feel I shall say
I have not understood
I have not understood any of this
My eyes are still coaldark
I have not understood
Around and in my eyes the tiny flecks
Of swirling crippled confused lights
And to my heart I will whisper
Softly quietly
""There is no death there is no death""
(And goodbye to you all)

Of London's great vaults

Under the sunpuckered roofs
Of Kathmandu
I have not understood

Of Lower
And of Higher Germanie
I have not understood

I have not understood
In Clare near I
the empty lakes are open in the distance
And too close is the famineretchingroad
All these are ghosts
There I have not understood
(In the Heart of the Wood
Oh there I have understood)
I rested at the temple of Great Black Time -- Her
And did not understand
Though animalbled fleshmarbled rivers ran in Her honour
His buckled body in blood
Returns to the prebirth poise
Spreadeagled like starfish --
There in His eyes:
Incomprehension mute pain disbelief what
Blood there meant sorrow trickles there
This I could not understand
I bend the pages of yet another book
And in its lines Great Black Lines
I have not understood
Please gramercy pray for me
And oh goodbye sweetestheart
The wind roars in the nearness
And there in my heart
And all the clouds are spiralling towards us
Descent indeed to the centre of it all
Skipping lightly and lying truly
This we shall understand
I hope...
We bent humped trees
The great ones -- there
On the lapped shore
Dai Ichi
There also I do not know
This is all unknowable
And as the dust covers
My empty eyes
You shall read in these foolish gapes
Oh that I have not understood
(But if you look for the stag and cross conjoined
there on my arm look there
There I have understood very well.)
Now you are all fading
All fading
As my age creeps on
As This Age stumbles on
Fires in the earth
Fires in the sky
Fires in our hearts
Fires everywhere
The black eyes
Already blacken
And this I have not understood
Not peace
But a sword
This and He
Unfortunately
I have understood
Under the bowered greenwood tree
When first I lay
Bright starre with Thee
Under the velvet branches dear
When sun and moon both came so near
Under the starlit open dome
Under the starsharp pointed lights
Under the starloved greeny earth
When first I wanted to hold You
And all the world halfdead and halflive
Spat into my mouth
Bluesea bitterwater
And I am almost dead
And I have not understood
Under the rain and teeth of gods
Under the pain and sleeping liddy eyes
Under the brokkèd wetful heaven
If you are there
If you are there
If you are there
Then I am singing with my eyes
If you are there"

And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes

And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted but it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed one more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show

The one that got away.
You knew it had to happen, the music grew intense.
In love affairs on oceans, the feelings seem immense.
Looks like they headed into stormy weather.
They saw it, even though they stuck together.
The one that got away.
Now he sees past the glamour, she sees past the lies.
The night is quick to anger, the dawn is slow to rise.
Who knows what the powers are that divide us?
She still keeps a photograph beside her.

Parked her car at the county court

Couldn't love him any less or hate him anymore

Bought a bottle then she called her boss
Waited for him at the motel lot til he got there
First he told her that her hair looked nice
Promised he was gonna leave his wife
Had two more lines but she didn't care
'Cause it was just like every other day before

Couldn't love him any less or hate him anymore

They said it his fault
Some Jazz about stress
That weren't the cause
There was no contract, no clause
But then it dawned
Was this some kind of test

Never happier
Wanted nothing more
But it all seems so mad
Throwing away everything
Breaking down the door
But life's a party
And thats what we're here for

Good intentions pave the way of the human child
Heading for the fork as you walk the path of life
A spell cast from the hiding woods, don't you close your eyes
The snake is waiting anytime to penetrate your mind
Don't you hear voices whispering, incline to walk down
Don't you see the shadow on the wall, angel eyes... the one cast out to fall
Calling me to look up to the sky we follow but we never know oh why
A vision revealing a child down where I've sure never been
An angel who's touching the flame, oh the angel is me
Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, let the cut run deep
Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, I said go - let bleed! - Go, - let bleed!

Feel it crawl, feel the magic coming over like a daze
Welcome as the poison for the cornered snake
Taste of sin, bitter sweet, never, never let us go
But never, never, never is a price we'd pay to grow
They call it original sin, some call it divine
The moment the evil appeared... the chance to decide

From children in cradles to hangmen who smile
Lick up the blood from the blade of your knife
Walk the stairway, leading down, ride on fire, take the crown
Your mind could be strong but your flesh will be mine
He's offering those kingdoms, they all could be thine
Rising powers, tempting gold, but at what price would it be sold?
It's all up to you...

Watching the aging rock star, coming through his satellite dish

The message is the medium and man that guy talks loud
He tells her that it's Earth Day and he loves all mankind
She gives that talking unicorn her body, soul and her mind
That American flag, you must invert
As the sweat pours down his Mexican wedding shirt
He leads her to oblivion
Now the Rose is dead and he's long gone

Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm

I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world

There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said,

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Justice means death of body and soul
You will surly learn it here

But it will cost your life if you try to convert`em
To convert`em out there

Sense of love has no place in here
Everything that`s lovely has to die now
And this is your own duty.

And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her

Damned to wait, as roots were fixed
For every hour, in hopeless fear,
It felt them leave then draw back near
The insects drudged without a sound,
And tore the plant down to the ground
Among them, one drone like any other,
Stole away to meet another
Far from the swarm, the two had hidden
Their unborn child, which was forbidden
Spiteful mind and eyes unseen,
Betrayed unto to a ruthless Queen
Condemned - the two would die alone,
Their egg was cast on to the stones
An offering to slake the earth,
Despite its lot, the child emerged
From hatching breath, its life was dire,
In every dawn, the sky brought fire
It sought its kind, and as it roamed,
Out of sight and far from home,
A pack could see that, left alive,
The child would lead them to the hive
Behind the hatchling, like a storm,
The giants fell upon the swarm,
With hungry teeth and gleeful hearts,
Those hunters pulled the Queen apart"

For I'll have none to comfort me when you are on the sea""
Well I took her by the lily white hand and I held her hard and fast
Saying ""adieu to you my darling for my ship it lies in Belfast
But if you prove loyal sure I'll prove true for you know that I'm well inclined""
So we kissed goodbye and parted and I left my girl behind
And when we landed in Greenock sure the people all gathered around
And they said I was a rakish lad come to put their harvest down
They told me to return again and never more be seen

And the mountain goats stick to the mountain sides
But the van broke down with a crick-crack sound
So we sat on the side of the road in Montana
A dirty old marmot hid beneath a tree
While the Kraken was unleashed to keep us company
Then the tow truck arrived and the journey revived
As we sped down the road for Cut Bank, Montana
We rolled into a town with streets full of bears
And arrangements were made for vehicular repairs
Then heard the good word as we were referred
To the only rental shop in Cut Bank, Montana
We waddled on over to a Loony Tune motel
With mercs at the door to deter the clientele
But we were ushered in by the mob's kingpin
Who was good ol' Mikey Burns, Prince Thief of Montana
Mikey Burns has got a Chevrolet Venture
Mikey Burns has got your ticket for adventure
He said when you're a-pressed with a policeman's concerns
Just tell 'em you borrowed it from good ol' Mikey Burns
We were led into his kitchen slash living room
Enshrouded by an aura of taxidermic doom
And where Mikey ate his meals he also did his business deals
Right there in his home in Cut Bank, Montana
We tried to haggle down but we were fools
This was Mikey Burns' town with Mikey Burns' rules
So we heeded his advice and paid the list price
And our minivan snarled west on 2 in Montana
It soon became clear that we had sold our souls
To the only man eligible in all the polls
The king of the town, the cock of the walk
Ol' Mikey Burns in Cut Bank, Montana
The sun comes up and the moon goes down
And the casino bars open all around the town
And Mikey Burns laughs all the way to the bank
Cuz you can't prank a crank up in Cut Bank, Montana"

In his castle of ancient times
Overlooking horizons wide
The angel of his life he though he'd found
But tragedy was set to be abound
Her heart was the one thing she could never give to him
Lonely as so many times before...
Alone with his mighty golden sword
He will conquer and be the lord
Obey the King of your land
And fight the blood from your hand

One he ruled all his lands with a firm irohand
Not a queen by his side never knew the reason why
At the end of the tale I now finally see

All alone on my throne once held powers so strong
Seerched for wisdom of Gods and the will to carry on

The blues just stepped in to keep me company
It's like a crazy breeze I just don't understand
The way I let my future slip right through my hand
Now I've got two empty arms with no one to hold
Two lovely lips that are fast growing cold
A heart with no sweethearts to love and keep it warm
Oh please come back to me and my two empty arms
It hurts to know I've lost the one I still adore
I'll never hear my name on his lips anymore
I'll only see his eyes when they smile at someone new
For in the memories my empty arms are clinging to

The day is no longer a day and the night is glowing
With the hellish colours of a rainbow.
Hollow ambition, earthly emotions, and power which
Gives an illusory taste of darkness.
You're dreaming of the gardens of eden but what you're
Really making are only contaminated coffins.
You desire to become god himself, yet finally you're
Opening the corridor to the one who controls the clockwork
Of light:"

In a bookstore on St. Clair
While he pushed the burning ingots
In Dofasco stinking air
Where the truth bites and stings
I remember just what we were
As the noon bell rings for
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
Hold on to your aching heart
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips
A small town hero never dies
He fades a bit and then he slips
Down into the blast furnace
In the heat of the open hearth
And at the punch clock he remembers
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
I remember your leather boots
Pointing up into the sky
We fell down to our knees
Over there where the grass grew high
Love hunters in the night
Our faces turned into the wind
Blackhawk where are you know
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
We were Blackhawk where are you know
We were Blackhawk where are you know"

They just don't matter
And how fast it all goes

That clock just starts ticking
Oh, the day that you're born
And no matter how much time you get
You always want more

The hottest day on record the forest tinder dry
Lightning strikes in the mountains
I was crew chief at the jump base
I prepared the boys to fly
Pick the drop zone C47 comes in low
Feel the tap upon your leg that tells you go
See the circle of the fire down below
Fifteen of us dropped above the cold Missouri waters
Gauged the fire I'd seen bigger
So I ordered them to side hill we'd fight it from below
We'd have our backs to the river
We'd have it licked by morning even if we took it slow
But the fire crowned jumped the valley just ahead
There was no way down headed for the ridge instead
Too big to fight it we'd have to fight that slope instead
Flames one step behind above the cold Missouri waters
Sky had turned red smoke was boiling
Two hundred yards to saftey
Death was fifty yards behind
I don't know why I just thought it
I struck a match to waist high grass running out of time
Tried to tell them step into this fire I've set
We can't make it this is the only chance you'll get
But they cursed me
Ran for the rocks above instead
I lay face down and prayed above the cold Missouri waters
Then when I rose like the phoenix
In that world reduced to ashes
There was none but two survived
I stayed that night and one day after
Carried bodies to the river
Wondering how I stayed alive
Thirteen stations of the cross to mark their fall
I've had my say I'll confess to nothing more
I'll join them now those that they left me long before
Thirteen crosses high above the cold Missouri waters"

Something passed the joy that I've collected and I felt,

240585,"crystal-eyes","eyes of the forrest gloom","[Music: Mikael Dahl o Lyrics: Mikael Dahl, Andreas Gotesson]
And so the story began with me falling
into a dream where the forest were calling
Closer and closer the twilight was dragging
me down to the unknown
so here I am all alone in the tree land
feeling the wind of my fate close at hand
Creatures of the night begins to take form
I'm surrounded now
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how it all began
I can't remembere anything
Yesterday's forever gone
I am trapped in a place beyond time
[Chorus]
And the moon is shining bright over the forest
And the creatures of the night won't let me rest
Beyond reality - for no one to see
Dark is the dream - no one hears my scream
I can't stand those staring eyes
Eyes of the forest gloom
Eyes of the forest gloom
Predator eyes that watch me intensely,
their gaze from the shadows are burning me slowly
Hunted I search for my way through the dreamscape
and it's feel so real
Will I survive? I have to wake up,
but deep inside I know that I'm trapped
Lost in a dream that's no longer a dream
My life is flashing by
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Bridge:]
Silver moonbeams light my way with their glow
Yet, gnarled trees rip my skin as I go
Deeper down into the ominous gloom
I'm afraid this path is leading to my doom
[Solo: Nyberg - Dahl]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
And so the story ends with me dying"

I saw the face of god there, staring back at me
Something pull's me softly through the void
The way back home will never be destroyed
One lays there, undiscovered
Taking fourth in another shape
From one thing to another
Moving on till the body breaks
I tried to find a place where no one's ever been
I always found a flag there, waving in the wind
All the time will slowly tick away
I feel you coming closer every day
Spreading out like vines that grow across the cold concrete
And then they they spill on down the hill and crawl back underneath
Like fingers reaching through the land to meet back at the sea
And I will walk beside them endlessly
Just like an empty bottle
A great shape hanging off to the side
Don't hide away tomorrow
Come back, return to life

Sat two hikers just watchin' cars go by
Now one was wearin' sandles with straggly matted hair
Rose colored glasses for his eyes
Now the other was a cowboy, he'd been down on his luck
Lost his money at the Tuscon Rodeo
And he sat beside what remained of his trusty pickup truck
And like the hippie now he's thumbin' down the road
Now some folks don't realize but it's a well know fact
Cowboy's and hippies ain't never got along
Now was it just coincidence or some weird act of fate
That brought these two together on the road?
Well they sat there without talking while the morning sun rose high
When a hot desert breeze commenced to blow
And the fragrance of the incense and six weeks without a bath
Finally drifted down and reached the cowboy's nose
Well, man that really did it, he couldn't take no more
And he tied his old bandana 'round his face
Said, ""You greasy stinking hippie you'd put a skunk to shame
Boy, you're a discrace to the human race""
Now the hippie he just sat there and gave the cowboy a smile
Said, ""Man you don't smell so sweet yourself
Well I'm not too sure what that green stuff is on your boots
And on your jeans but whew it's enough to make a buzzard belch""
The cowboy said, ""Now listen I ain't gonna that that stuff from you
No long haired freak's gonna talk to me that way, get up""
Well the hippie said, ""Now hold on man, what good's that gonna do
You know fighting never settles nothing anyway""
Said, ""You know man, in a lot of ways we're an awful lot alike
Once you get down beneath the skin
Like two books with different covers but the same words inside
We're both brothers of the wind""
""Now we both love our freedom and we'll answer to no man
And you've heard it said to thine own self be true
We're just a couple of free spirts drifting across the land
Doing exactly what we want to do""
Said, ""Now me I got my thing and you, you got yours
And I don't see why we can't get along
They say the closest thing to freedom is livin' on the road
In a country where freedom's almost gone""
Well the cowboy, he just stood up there and never said a word
But you know this hippie sure made a lot of sense
Well they shook hands and parted as a truck pulled to the side
And the hippie he went east and I went west"

We shared a bathroom in the hall
Stare at me through a crack in the door
Day I moved in I was playin' my guitar
Started bangin' on the wall with a boot
Then he came out, started banging on my door
Kicked it open

Spent his pension in adult bookstores
Bringin' strange young men home

Accusin' me of stealin' his toilet paper
Come out into the hallway
Dressed up in a greasy bathrobe
Tryin' to start a fight

The kind of love that lives beyond the laughter and the tears

Down to sleep in a pool of blood

No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say

Transfused at birth by my urban surroundings

Resistance and drive fueled by hunger

I just can't let shit get to me
Got to reflect back on what pop taught me
To be your own man no matter what
To never back down, and follow your gut
Instinct, something he said that I'd know
Something that I'd carry wherever I go
He told me someday I'd have to fight to be free
And resist the weight of gravity
Gravity won't allow me to fly
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger

Calloused hands wipe away tears
Of the pain of a man broken by years
A silent shot that nobody hears
A smoking gun of our own fears
My father worked all his life and for what?
Day in, day out, caught in a rut
The pain of apathy, razor-sharp cutting
But I'll make sure he doesn't die for nothing

There's a family Bible on the table each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over and when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us all from the old family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sittin' round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
And I can still hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
Now this world would oh so much better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me

When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone
Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
But how many fools would have you I know one
This fool keeps wonderin' why
He fell in love at all
But you might need this fool
Around in case you fall
After the party's over
And you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you I know one
You never know, you might be lonely
When all your loves have missed
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra
Fool on your list."

[The two friends were very lucky and the teleport device worked ! That teleport had always been used by the twin spirits to transport the infinte objects and fantasies contained in the European Kingdom stores to their consoles in order to create the dreams for their assigned sleeping humans. No one has ever tried to use the teleport in the opposite direction and get to the stores. But, it worked and, casually, they were sent to the European ""Japanes Fantasies"" store]
[Storyteller]
The two teleported themselves away from the European twin spirit land; they made it just in time to avoid being caught by the Dream League Force. There were many weird japanese objects that randomly disappeared, even though a twin spirit requested and teleported them away in order to create dreams. While the two were walking around, nearly lost in the endless area, their ears started to pick up a nice guitar melody comeing from somewhere. That music was not unknown to Genius..."

And fell in the Nettles.

And skipped the bits they loathed.
Didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
To advice his mind had closed

""Destiny is not a matter of chance.
It is a matter of choice.
It is not a thing to be waited for-
it is a thing to be achieved.
William Jennings Bryan""
A question fades
In the stillness of the air
I have to seek
The answer by myself
What if I don't?..
What if I quit?..
Life is a game
I'm the misfit
There is a scar
Cut deep, too far
Beyond my flesh
On through my soul
Lifetime dividing gash
Ten thousand dreams
And miles away
There's my lost yesterday
A peaceful flow
Through days... and maybe years
Among the thoughts
Of how it could have been...
If I was there
Back then again,
Was unaware
Of any pain
Day after day
It gets harder
To bear this scar
And overcome this depression bizzare
I close my eyes
And wonder why
Someone does not give up
A remedy-
The healing power
Is it really in me?..
Post Scriptum:
The idea for this song came after the tragedy that befell Jason Becker.
To the authors the way Jason treated this terrible SCAR is the clear example
of how a person, a human being DOES NOT GIVE UP in the face of earthly
misery and chooses to go on strugglingonly with the strength of his will.
This is indeed a choice to be respected. The authors would like to address
this song to those making their final choice of life and death."

I'm looking through a hole in the sky
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine
I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven

Yeah
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
But now I'm living on the profits of pride"

Strapped up in her fearing wall she had built
The independent girl in a dark and cruel world
She'd lost the way to say, ""OK, now lay back""
We disagreed on most things, I shouted peace and love
The family is mankind, the symbol of the dove
She only saw the surface of things before her face
But I was young and argued on for hours
My father he liked poetry, a scholar he might have made
Had nothing, born a poor boy barefoot and underpaid
So the man worked with his hands up and down the land
His dreams forgot he thought that I must follow
With his marks as worker's wisdom he'd read a thing or two
He once had been a Mason but he never followed through
Always kind and thoughtful, smelling of mushy oil
And he read me poetry of visionaries
I flunk my way to college, a looser kind of school
But we bobbed and played time arty, feeling cool
Just to live an artists diggin' the ravin' scene
Reading Kerouac and Ginsberg well deuced
I was not academic, Art and English neat
The history of mankind I liked that a bit
And what was I to do? The choices they were few

And my eyes turned green, like they do when I'm crying, and my heart it went to blue 'cause you told me that I might not be what you need, you want to try more out, but you're the only thing I can't stop thinking about.
Yeah, I like you a lot.. and I think it's worse than that.
You said you love it when all the words in a song move really fast and your ears have to choose just one little phrase to hold on to. And you love it when all the chords are really simple so you can play it on the guitar, and then when it goes to a funny one at the end you like that too (insert funny chord here). And so I'll build you a song, and I know you're gonna love it 'cause I'm putting in all the pieces that you said you wanted in it and I'm writing it here in my room in just my underwear and an orange t-shirt 'cause I know that you'd think that was hot.
Yeah hot, like that day that you called sick for work because we'd stayed out too late at The Cheesecake Factory the night before and we held hands on the beach, and I found that crab in a funny shell, and you took video of me holding it up by the newly painted blue motel. And you said ""I like you a lot"" and I thought 'well, this couldn't get much better.'
You said you were so happy you met me when you did 'cause you were starting to think you didn't like people. And you told me that when I moved that I could still stay in your room for weeks. But now I'm wondering if I imagined it or if it was ever really there 'cause they say even in magic nothing truly disappears, it just gets stuffed up somebody's sleeve or behind their hand or on top of their head.. and you forgot to keep your eye on it, you were looking down instead.
So now I'm the fool up on stage at the magic show searching the deck for my card while everyone laughs because they know that it's in plain sight to see, yeah it's stuck on your forehead, but I can't think you're mean 'cause I volunteered to be misled.

walk quite a ways through a big field, because the
song of the whippoorwill carried so well in the wind he
sound much closer then he really was. And on the way
the boy found a well worn trail, so he stayed on it for a
while. And sitting in the middle of the trail was coyote,
and coyote was singing too. He turned and saw the
boy and he said ""Why are you follow me?"" The boy
was frightened and said ""Well the trail you made
happened to be a short and easy way through this
field. Then coyote asked ""Well if your not following
me then why are you here?"" ""Well I heard the beautiful
song of the whippoorwill and wanted to watch him
sing."" ""Well do you not think my songs are beautiful?"",
said coyote. ""Oh"", said the boy, ""there good but I hear
you all the time. I much prefer the songs of the
whippoorwill"" This made coyote furious and he was
jealous of the whippoorwill's song. He said ""Listen to
my night song you might like this one"" And he pulled
back his head and yodeled out a tune. The boy
covered his ears and politely said, ""Thank you for the
song, but I must be going now."" ""Well"", coyote said, ""I
can show you a short cut to the whippoorwill boy, and
where he sings is just over there."" Pointing his claw,
smiling out of the side of his mouth. The boy paused,
looked around, he knew the night was passing fast so
he agreed to follow coyote. But coyote's trail was
rough and rocky. And the boy fell in quite a few
gopher holes along the way. Coyote turned around
and laughed and he yelled to the boy. ""Were almost
there, hurry up."" Coyote was at a full trot but the boy
had just fallen again and hurt his knee. And by the time
he got to the place where the whippoorwill had been
singing all night, it was morning. Whippoorwill was
gone. And so was coyote, in fact he could hear
coyote's songs in another field. So the boy turned and
headed for home, covered with burrs, misq bites and a
skinned up knee. And it was many summers later
when the boy became a wiser man. And he realized,
there are no shortcuts to find something you really

For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan

And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand

It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on the shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise

Moving on into the restless age

Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings

Tell me, where have all the good times gone?
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah, we had a good time)
Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past?
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you
They've gone away
Gone, they've gone away
Gone, they've gone away
They've gone away

And sad to see it played again

Let my flesh die?

My carnal mind tells me
From sin there will be no rest
Because of sacrificial rights

Once a slave to mortality

Ten thousand angels rush the wind against my back

has been echoed throughout the ages, for without the metallurgist, we
could not have such musical things as triangles, cymbals, margerine
tubs, or guitar strings. Guitar strings are produced by the
wire-drawing process, where solid metal is pulled through dies with
progressively smaller diameters, until the desired diameter, or guage,
is reached. The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility,
and seperates metals from other materials, such as wood, ceramics, or
plastic milk jugs, which are made by the blow-molding process. You
put the milk in later.

Your golden curls in disarray upon your starched white pillow case
The soft blue satin covers pulled up tight around your lovely throat
It almost makes me want to go destroy the message on the note
The note I left upon your perfumed stationary by the phone
I hate to think about you waking up at dawn to find me gone
It hurts me so to get up in the middle of the night and go
But thinking back I do remember faintly that I told you so
I told you I was like a bird a free and wild and restless thing
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly
I only know that I must go and nothing here must hold me back
I like the love you gave me and the tender way you scratched my back
I like your warm sweet kisses and the way you cook your ham and eggs
I like the way the suntan lotion softened up your lovely legs
I like the static noise I heard when you would sit and brush your hair
The way you gave yourself to me and never asked to go nowhere
But most of all I like the way you always smiled and never frowned
The way you took this chance for love and grasped me just for what I am
I told you I was like a bird
And now my darling as I leave I fight the yearning in my blood
To wake you up and love you just once more before I go for good
But somehow I am fighting back my passion for I cannot stay
And someday you'll look back and know best it ended up this way

Complain and blame the sterile land

But in an unnatural quirk the embryos fused
And I absorbed my embryonical sibling into me
From my earliest fetal stages into adulthood

We matured together in the oddest ways
Together as one we were born to be

A living abnormality for scientific study
Tumorous growths on and in my body cause me pain
Of dermoid origins, these tumors are pieces of my brother
These teratomas sprout across my body
As my fragmented sibling develops from my torsos
My brother lives within
Inside lays the internal twin
My stomach contains rows of his teeth
Molars and incisors grow from the organ walls
And scalp hair clumps from external teratocarinomas
His bulbous eyeballs protrude from my right temple and ear
They twitch inside misshapen sockets
Sightless they roll and gaze into black
A toothless cartilage mouth opens from my chest
Its rubbery spasms will never speak a word
And his retarded raging thoughts I hear
He bellows and cries inside of my skull
His berserk, confused substratum shrieks drive me mad
His underdeveloped brain grows from mine
And his retarded raging thoughts I hear
He bellows and cries inside of my skull
Always he has shared my vital organs
My heart, my lungs, and pulsing blood
Since birth his survival has depended on me
His nurturing has me to thank
I am sorry brother I can no longer live like this

The evil haunts you,
The night is through and tomorrow loves to watch you die.
The sin of godless,
Trails to the scent of us and you are drowned in the lust.
The unknown,
Grim and bleak and this blight of life becomes a crimson strife.
The sin of loveless caused by a need to escape,
Escape to...
Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever faced will take you down.
Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever embraced will haunt you,
Haunt you like it's part of you.
Raise your head for the last time,
This life is through no tomorrow to greet my wretched smile.
The scorn of the godless,
Born of a virgin whore escapes to...
Can't bring desire,
But you'll feel the night,
Can't feed the fire that you are,
The sweet delusion,
Still you feel the night."

[""SLEEP DEPRIVATION"" THEME:]
Sleep and then you will see,
As you even can't imagine yourself
As sometimes all of the things
Overturn upside-down...
Oh, my dearest!
They seem to be real
And all of them -
I mean those people are sheep who do not differ from one an another
Sleep and then you will see...
Have a look at your dreams -
They are burning in flames
Like the rags torn asunder.
And under you feet...
Can't you see dying days?
You cannot leave
Your sweet ""sleepering"" chamber
Nobody minds,
That's only a dream.
It's high time to go ahead to bed...
Nothing yet...
Almost done,
Two-faced devil's child,
Rise and cry;
""Nobody won
Anyone,
And lost this one either...
Having arrived from the other side,
Forlorn in silent pride"".
Mist and disease do exist in your dreams.
Strange flames are waltzing so beautiful now
Under your feet
And on your way home;
There is no need to cure:
They are your sick overture
Before you go insane at all.
Autumn flames stole your dreams...
Dancing flames stole your soul...
Nobody minds if you fall asleep.
Sleep if you can,
Sleep if you will.
Sleep if you see the bright light next to me.
Sleep if you dare to watch my surprise.
Sleep 'cause I don't care
Haven't you heard my nice lullabies!
[THE ""WOODEN LADLE"" THEME:]
Some people only need in food and want to muck
Some of them got to live in fight and have bad luck
Some of them born with a silver spoon in a mouth
And the others with a wooden ladle...
You'll have seen as...
Shall we be fighting with the sin
Has spread abyss as endless sea?
You mean us: It won't touch me
Even if I follow all these fools...
Some people have got to drown and die
In seas or in a glass of wine
And if you share their way -
You will have got the most of attributes.
Dominion do we need? Not quite...
Oh, you had better listen to the rustle of the silent days.
Watch as poor mankind does make a million ways -
During its countless nights and days
Caught in a trap full of deadly haze. -
It always does search for itself.
Betray!
Don't give them another chance anymore.
Let them disappoint themselves more and more
Let them drown in bloody sea and stay on the shore. -
They yet wanted all the cares and got them all!
What have you got in a mouth - in a mouth of yours
Who knows of this delicious one tell me - I can't suppose
Let me look at this one in a mouth of yours
Perhaps it sounds great and looks so fun... I suppose
You cannot stay outside the death.
First one that's looking very sad
Don't try to be a GOD
Therefore you cannot be a GOD,
Poor mortal whore
You will have known it very soon
Who gets a ladle or a spoon
Why did you get your wooden one
And who had thrown it into your mouth.
Nobody did believe this:
Thou art not a GOD.
The thoughts of thine with thy wrath are falling apart
Because of idiotic ae thou dost keep in thy mouth...
With ladle thou wert made...
Thou shalt not become the devilkin before it is too late.
Thy wooden ae doth make thee weep
It doth not want thee to eat or sleep -
It doth make thy path pass away
Thou art getting paler day by day...
Try to appease thy angry daemon and keep him in thy mouth
Feed him by thy flesh and thy bones far more than usual
Thou art poor mortal whore...
There is wonderful place - there is beautiful place
Keep your temper - you are not to be in a maze
There is haze of oblivion - wonderful haze
There is wonderful place for your future remains.
[""SLEEP DEPRIVATION"" THEME:]
Sleep fast and do not be afraid:
When you will have awoke
You'll be rich and mighty as before,
""Mad sea alike thou winna know
Of thine shore, poor mortal whore!""
Sleep and then you will see
Dark and bottomless sea,
Sleep and then you will buy
Hidden essence of thine.
Come along side by side
Next to your filthy pride.
""Evil demons of time
Will have not passed thee by.""
Wonder I if you'd mind
Dying now in a sleep?
You are poor mortal whore.
You're degenerate sheep!
Sleep and then you won't see
As the hollow - eyed darkness comes.
Sleep and then you won't see
As the blind moon is arising,
Sleep and then you won't see
All of the sudden cares,
You even do fear
To think of them again and again
Sleep and then you won't see
Sleeping grim entity
If the nightmares of yours
Not suffocate you before.
You are poor mortal whore.
You won't wait for salvation
Whilst you have your nightmares
And sleep deprivation
Sleep and then you will see
Two faces of GOD!!!
Well, it's time to reveal our forces and might
You don't know how to manage him who has arrived
You have done all the screaming already and now
Wring your hands in despair and o don't ask me ""How
Am I t' stop it?"" - If you leave off rowing it will
Stop of itself - What are you to reveal?
So the boat of yours was left to drift down the stream
So you're desperate one's left to drift down the stream
Lo the blade of one of the oars got fast in the
Water and would not come out again
And the consequence was that the handle of it
Caught you under your chin thus got under your feet!"

'68 Stallion Music
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
You can't see a mem'ry of love that's untrue
Hear a tear fall or a heart break in two
You can't draw on paper the picture of pain
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappears when it dies
A heart sheds no tears still you know that it cries
You can't see how empty a soul is inside
There are some things words just won't describe
You can't see the future though you've known the past
Or know how long a love hurt will last
Blue mem'ries burn though you don't see the flame
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappears...

If you were mine I would quench your thirst
Like a tall glass of water
You would be my one desire
I would kiss you like a house on fire
Baby I would burn like crazy
If you were mine
If you were mine
If you were mine
You're everything I can't resist
Just to hear your voice is bliss
It is,yeah it is
If you were mine I would shout it out
We'd show the world what love's about
We'd never sleep in our big old bed
We'd just kiss and kiss and kiss instead
If you were mine I would be complete
Nothing would be missing baby
If you were mine
If only you were mine"

When I first saw her there
Standin' there in a sweat stained stetson
With her cow at the County Fair
I thought I knew how to make a move
But I can't make her mine
I wish I could forget her
But there's just somethin' in her smile
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
Well her momma said, She liked old westerns
So I did my best John Wayne
Said, I bet we'd go together
Like grits on a gravy train
When I leaned in she gave a little grin
And puckered up her lips
And hit right where she was aimin'
Now there's a little brown stain on my blue tag
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
I know it's wrong but I can't resist
Thinkin' 'bout the taste of that first kiss
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance

Our ship's sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
It's ribs are ceiling beams
It's guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill
You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But, I remember you
And I will relate to you
How our histories interweave
At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(Oh, oh)
You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease
As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(Oh, oh)
And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind
Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But, before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried:
(Oh, oh)
""Find him, find him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave""
It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat
But, never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever, once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(Oh, oh)
One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty
The following day
I shipped to sea
With a privateer
And in the whistle
Of the wind
I could almost hear
(Oh, oh)
""Find him, find him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave
There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed""
And then, that fateful night
We had you in our sight
After twenty months, it seemed
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath
The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale
(Oh)
Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive
As well as me
It gives my eye great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
To lean in close
And I will whisper
The last words you'll hear
(Oh, oh)"

It's the same old song
Nobody wants to hear
Well I'm a product of the Bocefus generation
Now what they call country
Really gets me aggravated
Well it's a fact
To many acts with a big contract
Can't sing a note

Ain't music to my ears

'Cause when I turn on the radio
It makes me, make me wanna say

And songs were country

He's got a big pimp daddy attitude
He's got a gold tooth grill
And some spinning wheels
That he had to steal
It's the boomiest
It's the bassiest
And those baggy pants are weird

I've never seen a white boy
You've so much activate him
Well my ears are shot
'Cause I bet he's got a hundred thousand watts
And a dozen amps
'Cause it breaks my lamps

Keep it down I'm tryin' to sleep
Then he pops in Dr. Dre
As he flips a bird at me

The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena; whose faces are marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strive valiantly; who err and come up short again and again; who know the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, and spend themselves in a worthy cause, who at the best know in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who are at the worst, if failing, at least fail while daring greatly; so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."" - Theodore Roosevelt]"

Now don't she look good when she smiles?
Don't she look good in the new dress I bought her?
And the new way that she wears her hair?
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?
Oh, don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?"

(Earl Green - Carl Montgomery)
Â« Â© '58 Southern Arts Music, BMI Â»
Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh a rollin' down that Eastern Sea board
I got my diesel wound up and she's a runnin' like a never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
I got me ten forward gears and my George overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in white I been passin' everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women but I'm not like that sort of a guy
I could find one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's alright
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
ICC is a checkin' on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight I can dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from my stack and that smoke's some blowin' like it's coal
My hometown's a comin' in sight if you think I'm a happy you're right
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight"

You're going to pay because you've eaten bone char
But that won't happen to me, because I'm sugar free
I'm the best vegan that I can be
You try to do what's right, at least you say you do
But you choose the white, not the pink or blue
You'd better watch your back, you'd better start to pray
Vegan revolution is just a T-shirt away
You say you're cruelty free, well you're not to me
A Zagnut and a Pepsi are the things I see
And your habit's why innocent creatures die
Their lives destroyed because of what you buy

Let no man breach the gate to this most blasphemous of halls
Lest bitterness and chaos be the harvest they wouldst reap
He must n'er become a slave to this Child's beck and call
For she must never waken from her Crimson Sleep..
The monastery stood towering above the ruined city
It shadowed all the new emerging settlements and homes
To look down on the ruins was to sympathize and pity
All the suffering and heartache, all the graves and broken bones
For buried there a testament to the evil of a queen
A misery that spread across a weak and stricken land
The crimson birth that swamped the earth in dark and deadly dreams
And all mankind did bow beneath the power of her hand
And in the monastery garden sat a woman with a book
A manuscript that lay within her frail and trembling arms
She looked around her nervously as guilt rose in her heart
But the sway of curiosity had drawn her out too far
She wavered on the threshold of a dangerous decision
For this dark tome was no for human eyes to ever read
The pages dripped with legions of persuasive words and visions
So the volume had been hidden well, but now it had been freed
For no apparent reason had the woman been drawn in
Perhaps it was a twist of fate, an absence of real thought
She wandered to a room that before she'd never been
And all at once the interest of her senses had been caught
For no apparent reason had the women been drawn in
Where rows of dusty books lay in an ominous display
But one ancient leather binding had the grain of human skin
And seized with curiosity she stole this book away
And now she sat alone in the concealment of the night
She was hungry now to liberate the writings from their cage
The glimmer of a feeble moon provided her with light
As she opened up the cover and began to read the page
Fly, soul, the body's guest,
Upon your impish arrant
Let none be guiled by false confession
Truth shall be your warrant
Fly soul for your body must die
But for those who seek eternity
For those who yearn prosperity
From this single act of sanity
Will raise you far above humanity
Oh willing host who doth not know
The full desire of this prisoner
You walk where angels fear to go
Thou shalt soon embrace the reckoner
Thy halo of glory, hope's true gage
May prove to be an evil pilgrimage
Something had happened beyond her control
A moment of madness unfettered a soul
That would relish a freedom denied once before
By a desperate nation with it's back to the wall
Within a split second of reading this text
The spirit was free and had fled from its nest
It was eager to grow from this sudden reprieve
And thus in the woman a life was conceived
From the beginning the world was misled
As a baby was born in a monastery bed
The miracle happening here on this Earth
Was perceived as a glorious new Virgin Birth
From the moment in time that baby was born
The sun did now rise on a new Crimson dawn
And the creature just bided its time undiscovered
So safe in the cradling arms of the mother
[Lead: Dan]
But for those who seek eternity
For those who yearn prosperity
From this single act of sanity
Will raise you far above humanity
Secure from the world, the child remained hidden
A serpent disguised in the Garden of Eden
And all who looked down on this newly born babe
Were ignorant now of the path this would take
The people were blind to the subtle control
That was exercised daily upon every soul
With no room to question this delicate life
All fears would be drowned and all doubts would be stifled
But one single mind did stand out from the crowd
Though quiet at first - with hardly a sound
The Mother Superior harbored suspicion
Brought to her heart by three simple vision
[The Visions:]
The first was a planet engulfed by the sea
No dry land in sight, not a mountain or tree
No rock jutted out from the endless horizon
Or flowers to mark out the changing of seasons
No animals dwelt in the forests or fields
All life was extinct; its fate had been sealed
By the curse of a violent unstoppable flood
Mankind had been drowned in an ocean of blood
The next revelation was vivid and cruel
It depicted two swordsmen engrossed in a duel
The one held a sword that was silver and pure
The other a sword that was red to the core
They fought as the sun rose high in the sky
Their fight would not end until one of them died
No room did they have for an error to make
For the future of life was the trophy at stake
But one of the warriors flouted the rules
And with cunning and guile had the other one fooled
As he held up his hands in a gesture of peace
The silver opponent allowed this retreat
Then the man with the red sword attacked from behind
Left the silver sword fighter defeated and blind
Then carnage ensued that no man could condone
As the bloody red blade sliced through sinew and bone
All day did the swordsman attack without halt
Though the other lay dead from the frenzied assault
Until by the twilight and all that remained
Were the echoes of death and a fresh crimson stain
And so came the third of these unyielding visions
A picture of war and ferocious divisions
An army of saviors marching as one
Aware that the end had already begun
They arrived in a field, which was wide and expansive
They waited in silence both ready and pensive
The grassland was strewn with small crimson petals
Their fragrance was sweet with the stench of the devil
And slowly but surely they fell into sleep
Their consciousness gone as they slumped in defeat
And there they still lie bereft of their willpower
Brought to their knees by the strength of a flower
The three visions, the Mother Superior bore
A bitter forewarning of what was in store
This infant so frail must not grow to be strong
The world was at risk if she waited too long
So veiled by the blackness of night she did creep
And enter where mother and child were both asleep
And onwards she moved to where the crib lay
She leant over the baby and started to pray
She prayed for forgiveness for what she would do
She prayed that the knife in her hand would aim true
But all of a sudden she was now paralyzed
The baby daughter had opened her eyes
[Lead: Mike]
And into those eyes, the woman gazed
The look in her face was both haunted and crazed
She was smothered and swamped in confusion and sadness
The first to be gripped by this foul crimson madness
This brutal psychosis could not be explained
No one single cause was suggested or blamed
But no one could think that a child was involved
And the mystery illness remained unresolved
So all seemed as normal for seven short years
A veil of deception dissolved any fears
But there was one lapse in the child's disguise
And that could be seen in the depths of her eyes
The message could clearly be discovered there
In the glimpse of the universe found in her stare
Her gaze hypnotic, unbearably strong
Suspicions were growing, it wouldn't be long
Oh willing host who doth not know
The full desire of this prisoner
You walk where angels fear to go
Thou shalt soon embrace the reckoner
Now and then a question would be raised
Strong misgivings threatened to be voiced
But these were judgments wiser not to say
To doubt the child could prove to be a rash and deadly choice
By now the Crimson reign had proved too much
The monastery was shadowed under dread
But fear decreed that hostile thoughts be crushed
For the creature had the power to crawl inside your head
The mother in her darkest moment knew
The time had come for action to be taken
A journey must be made to hidden truths
She must return and read again the book she had forsaken
This tome presented many further views
Essential rules of power were revealed
And thus the pages offered up one clue
The child bore one significant Archilles Heel
Should the Crimson Queen be blinded, then powerless she'll be
Bereft of piercing vision, her victims will be free
Salvation lies in banishing this creature to the dark
Let not your hand be hesitant or death will be your mark
Lest regained sight should speed her flight away from burning hell
A steady heart must seal her back within her crimson cell
And thou who didst release this most vindictive enemy
Must serve to be her warder there for all eternity
One quiet night the lady traveled out beyond the monastery
Her quest was one of urgency and human preservation
She traveled with companions to reach the ruined city
Where lay the means to save her kind, a path to their salvation
When there they searched for evidence of where the Queen once slept
And came upon a gateway, which was tightly closed and barred
A stark inscription warned them of the risk of their next step
But choices were no more; they had already come too far
Let no man breach the gate to this most blasphemous of halls
Lest bitterness and chaos be the harvest they wouldst reap
He must n'er become a slave to this Child's beck and call
For she must never waken from her Crimson Sleep:
[Lead: Mike]
With fresh resolve the women carried on towards their goal
And found themselves a cell where crimson shade were scattered
A sight so dreadful it chilled their very souls
The cell had long been drained and all around the glass lay shattered
A movement in the shadows
A flash of blazing light
The child stood before them
With murder in her eyes
The women ran towards her
To try to stem the tide
Of purse and crimson anger
There was nowhere left to hide
Too slow was their reaction
They were thrown back off their feet
Their throats were filled with panic
As they stared as harsh defeat
Too weak was their protection
They couldn't staunch the trail
Of vitriol and vengeance
Meted out for this betrayal
So the mother's brave compatriots
Consumed with damning pain
Died writhing in the dirt
They were bleeding and insane
They'd looked into the child's eyes
And crumbled in despair
From images too hideous
For human minds to bear
Salvation lies in banishing
This creature to the dark
Let not your hand be hesitant
Or death will be your mark""
But there was still one single hope
No room for fear or doubt
The mother knew there was no choice
She had to end this now
She crawled across the bloodstained ground
Her eyes averted from the steely glare
But secretly she knew she'd found
A way beyond this nightmare
[Lead: Simon/Mike]
A few more seconds spanned the path
Between success or damnation
Mankind would face the aftermath speed
Of this deadly confrontation
Got to strike for the eyes
Leave the monster running blind
Go to cross the line
Got to strike for those unforgiving eyes
She veiled herself with trivial thought
A mask of insignificance
Her daughter failed to see beyond
The fabric of irrelevance
For a moment they were face to face
No sign of what was soon to be
But still her mind refused to break
Those thoughts must not be seen
Got to strike for the eyes
Leave the monster running blind
Go to cross the line
Got to strike for those unforgiving eyes
[Lead: Simon]
Striking hard, striking fast in desperation
The world around is filled with shades of red
Forced to stand in weak anticipation
As rivulets of blood run down the Child's head
The chamber fills with screams of violent rage
Of petulance and impotent frustration
Consumed with frenzied tidal waves of hate
The princess falls to earth in dark sedation
Her blindness stunts the growth of nascent power
That grows within her like some poisonous flower
The blade of darkness strikes her to the hilt
And so the flower inside begins to wilt
But time is short for action to be taken
No chance to dwell on pity or mistakes
No chance for dark excuses to be found
The moment of Salvation must be now!
Cast me to the crimson flames
Thou hast the power should I be blind
To overthrow my wicked reign
And throw me to the pit of time
Cast me to the crimson flames
Thou shalt bar the doors of hell
Incant these words of sacred rule
Seal me in my crimson cell
[Lead: Dan]
And thus was read the incantation
Voices echoed round and round
The woman smiled in weak elation
Mesmerized inside the sounds
[Lead: Dan]
And with these chants of higher lore
So mortal flesh began to fade
Soon child and mother were no more
Their earthly bodies now decayed
Cast me to the crimson flames
Thou shalt bar the doors of hell
Incant these words of sacred rule
Seal me in my crimson cell
[Lead: Mike]
And still inside the chamber stands
A single cell with crimson hue
Resealed by spoken word of Man
Imbued with power from spiritual Truth
Two souls imprisoned for eternity
Light and dark forever bound
Two souls that never can be freed
A pathway back will not be found
For trapped beyond some foolish reach
And far away from prying eyes
No channel now to lead or preach
No chance to influence or guide
The final sacrifice she took
Ensured the hope of the human race
And thus she holds the sacred book
A captive in her crimson space
Lest bitterness and chaos be the harvest they wouldst reap
For she must never waken from this Crimson Sleep

It must have been back in my teens
I was such a basket case when I was young
It's obviously something that I dreamed
I have always been a most reclusive kind of guy
When love's around I usually run and hide
Don't you go believin' I was ever that confused
I was really only waiting for you
[Chorus]
Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you
And I cannot escape the over-whelming feeling
Destiny has taken us in hand
And nothing that we do is gonna change
The way this love affair is never gonna end
And I know it's hard getting used to the idea
That your lover wants to be your best friend
With a showing of affection and a measure of romance
This is really only waiting for you
[Chorus]
Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you
Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you
I've been living by myself I do not want for someone else
At least that's what I like to say
And it was working till the other day I met you
And I fell in love from twenty yards away
I've got one last truly great love left in my life
And my heart is tellin' me it might be you
So forget your disappointments I'll forget about my past
I was really only waiting for you

Really only waiting for you

Anything whatever that you want to last forever"

But, there's just one thing that I want you to know
I'll love you till the day I die
Oh, we let other people tear us apart
And for no good cause you see
But, I hope and pray you'll be mine someday
You'll live and love each other, you and me
So if you go, don't say goodbye
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
For without you I'm the one that is lost

When my life and my moods were in order and fine
But the hour was late and my room was a state
And I realized that song I would never create
And so this is a song I discovered instead
The song about living before we are dead
And by living I don't mean prfection like gold
Cos living my friends is the sweet unresolved
La la la la la la la
Lean over your balconies and don't run inside
Look after your world and she might treat you right
Let random-things-provide-imagination sometimes oh
I've seen people trying to package their love
Like a dove in the kitchen with a note that says
Make sure you scrub well and plan and prepare everything
Affection as clean as a triangle ting
But love it or not love's as mad as they come
Oh it's sly and it's wise and it's wonderfully dumb
And while some might still say 'No it's pure like one'
My love it is wild and not mild and on the run
An Austrian waltz is a very strange thing
When it's played in the midst of a Melbourne music boxing ring
And who said that culture couldn't grow from a whim
My god there is strength when a cat learns how to swim
'And what is a king' he screamed at the wind
A king is decisive without and within
They can't make me stumble they don't hit my chin
They told me I mumbled so I decided to sing"

And at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight.
Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray.
And I write this note to say, why Paddy's not at work today.
While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear.
Now to throw them down from such a height, was not a good idea.
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod.
He said I'd have to carry them down the ladders in me hod.
Now, clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow.
So I hoisted up a barrel, and secured the rope below.
But in me haste to do the job, I was too blind to see;
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me.
So when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead.
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead.
While I shot up like a rocket, to my dismay I found,
That halfway up, I met the bloody barrel coming down.
Well, the barrel broke my shoulders as to the ground it sped,
And when I reached the top, I banged the pulley with me head.
Well I clung on tight though numb and shock from this almighty blow,
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below.
Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor,
I then outweighed the barrel, and so started down once more.
Still clinging tightly to the rope, I sped towards the ground.
And I landed on the broken bricks that were all scattered 'round.
While I lay their groaning on the ground I thought I passed the worst,
When the barrel hit the pulley wheel, and then the bottom burst.
Well a shower of bricks rained down on me - I hadn't got a hope.
As I lay there moaning on the ground: I let go of the bloody rope.
The barrel then being heavier it started down once more,
And landed right across me as I lay across the floor.
Well it broke three ribs, and my left arm, and I can only say;
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today."

Waiting for the floor to creak and
And something goes bumpity bumpity bump up the stairs

Just think of the summer
And swimming in sky blue, drift your mind away
So when next time comes
You feel you're being followed by a
Fool with a highly intelligent bear for a pet
Just turn and lead it by the hand
And lead it home and tell it
""Take it from me that you need all the friends you can get""

Silver Eagle, Lonely Road,
I was on my way to Mobile,
For a big new year's eve show,
Stopped for just a minute,
To see a friend outside of town,
With my collar up, I found his name,
And felt the wind die down,
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat,
Took me by surprise,
Wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit, and haunted, haunted eyes,
He said friend it's good to see you,
It's nice to know ya care,
Then the wind picked up and he was gone,
Was he ever really there?
[Chorus]
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery,
Just hear that wipperwill,
See the stars light up the purple sky,
Feel that lonesome chill,
'Cause when the wind is right,
You'll hear his song,
Smell whisky in the air,
Midnight in montgomery,
He's always singin' there,
Well I climbed back on that eagle,
Took one last look around,
Red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground,
And off somewhere a midnight train, is slowly passin' by,
I can hear that wistle moanin',
I'm so lonesome I could cry,
[Chorus]
He's always singin there
Well Hank's always singin' there."

And remember another night
When Mama played the organ,
And we turned off all the lights
And we all stood around her
And sang Silent Night
The organ is quiet now,
And Mama's gone
The sound of that Christmas Eve
Will live on and on
We sang all the old carols,
The hymns she loved to hear
And she played them over, one by one,
From memory, and by ear
And then she'd find the ancient album,
With its pages turned gold
And the crayon-colored paper star
I made so long ago
But brighter than any star
Was the love in Mama's eyes
As she said, ""Merry Christmas, kids"",
And she kissed us goodnight
And the organ's quiet now,
And Mama's gone
But the sound of that Christmas Eve
Will live on and on
The years have gone by now,
Since that last Christmas Eve
But the joy is still with me,
And the love will never leave

And we turned off all the lights
And we all stood together
And sang the last Silent Night"

Smite the people with vengeance and bring damnation upon their descendants

Clinically deranged norepinephrine driving me insane

In his beat-up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said 'I'm here to help you, ma'm
By the way, my name's Joe.'
She said 'I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.'
When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said 'How much do I owe you?'
Here's what he had to say
'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.'
Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
She must have been eight months
Along and dead on her feet
No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her
Change from a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a nakpin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she wrote
'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.'
That night when she got
Home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking about the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
'Everything's gonna be alright
I love you, Joe.'"

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash , they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash
They did the mash , they did the monster mash
If you've ever seen a monster before
Dancin' across the dance floor
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout
Turn around and help the monster turn it out
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
And if you don't have core hard cash
You can still do the monster mash
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash

Guess, you've tried everything
To be as me, to winback the soul I've kindly been
Treating like my only son
God's shiny angel, I am gone
and you what the hell have you become?
Abandoned son, my fairly fallen angel, come on
And tell your father, what will we become!?
Angels, we dwell in hell, humiliating and sad as well
The world succumbed, some tell
And there I stand stone-still, hence
In my own non-existance and muse upon consequence!
Blood stained clay, forth from our sacred dissaray
Someone will walk a new way
And will close the door 'twixt us and common core
Angel, did you really want this war?
Scarlet lips of indecency (Scarlet lips of perversity)
In search for a splintered tongue (Matching each face disguised)
Sharpened words of intimacy
They'll need (all) my love (They'll need my hatred)
Sapience, pierce my flesh with your thorns of irony
Angel falls and twists her wings and her gleaming breasts
will rot like foul flesh, hence worms will dance
to a macabre romance... the rape of sweetness in my eyes
Decrepitude, pierce my tongue with your womanliness
Suck the honey of my breath and tear faith apart
Scratching suicidal love on life's putrid skin
I am your mortal son, so I am sin!!!
Oh ye, in hell we are, humiliated and bizarre
How only I have reached so far, my star
And you, across that melting sky
Waiting for me to die
For everything must die, and within everything am I"

The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
For his country he sighed, when at twilight reparing.
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.
But the day-star attracted his eyes' sad devotion,
For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,
When once in the fire of his youthful emotion,
He sang the loud anthem of Erin-go-Bragh.
""Sad is my fate!"" said the heart-broken stranger :
The wild-deer and wolf to a convert can flee.
But I have no refuge from famine and danger-
A home and a country remain not to me.
Never again, in the green sunny bowers,
Where my forefathers lived, shall I spend the sweet hours,
Or cover my harp with the wild-women flower,
And strike to the numbers of Erin-go-Bragh.
""Erin, my country ! though sad and forsaken,
In dreams I revisit thy sea beaten shore:
But alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more
O! cruel fate ! wilt thou never replace me
In a mansion of peace where no perils can chase me?
Never again shall my brothers embrace me.
They died to defend me, or live to deplore.
""Where is my cabin door, fast by the wild wood?
Sisters and sire, did you weep for its fall?
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood?
And where is the bosom friend dearer than all?
O! my sad heart! long abandoned by pleasure,
Why did it dote on fast-fading treasure?
Tears, like the rain-drops, may fall with-out measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall."

Feeling with the deepest desires to indulge in bestiality
Whether it was dogs, cattle, sheep or horse
Animals are raped easily, they cannot scream for help
Though they must be restrained as they kick, bite and yelp
Erotic zoophilism, a sexual abnormality
A behavior disorder that's controlling me
With women I'm stuck with complete impotence
I've found the best piece of ass walks on four legs
The kind you can ride, herd or rolls over and begs
I must muzzle a dog to prevent a serious bite
Rear limbs spread and tied, I fuck a canine tonight
As I orgasm inside, thoughts cause me to wonder
I imagine a litter of man-pups suckling the bitch mother
Sexually stimulated at the sight of fur
My erotic preferences shall disgust for sure
For lesser creatures I am lust crazed
My finest fucks in the pasture laid
With livestock of all kinds I've had intercourse
Only with animals I wish to have sex
Erotic zoophilism, a sexual abnormality
A behavior disorder that's controlling me
With women I'm struck with complete impotence

Rear limbs spread and tied, I fuck a canine tonight
As I orgasm inside, thoughts cause me to wonder...
Deep in my being, I tap my primal core
Plunging into the worst form of impiety
As I betroth in sacrilegious unions
With the most feral zoological breeds
My most primitive instincts take controls
Excited by various wild and barnyard scents
Into a bovine rump I will soon trespass
Relinquishing human milt beneath a quadruped tail
Animalia in heat ignites unwholesome desire
Coitus with certain species quenches the fire
Slipping into the vaginal gape of a mammalian mate
Hybrid horrors created, if I inseminate
Domesticated and wild brutes sickenly laid
Pregnancies prevented with the beasts are spayed
Erotic zoophilism, a sexual abnormality
A behavior disorder that's controlling me

Waves are cutting like a knife of time
On the slippery rocks that still stands besides the
shore
Two eyes are eyeing the seas
Towards the seas that once brought his ancestors
glory
A lonely mind is longing
For the raising of sails
A swordarm is longing hungrily
To cut the throats of cowards
A forgotten treasure is now recovered
Brought out from the darkness of Midgard
Its powers will never again disappear
It is guarded by a man from Hordaland
A night of sorrow will soon be over
Memories from ancient times will glow
A wind blows away the dust from an ancient
sword
Two ravens will predict his return
The sun sets in the west
He lifts his proud face
He looks towards the North Star

While lines of weekend window shoppers just kept rollin' by
I spotted him from my old truck as he stood out in the crowd
He was a little more than twice my age, but he still looked strong and proud
Hadn't seen my uncle now since I was seventeen
And the stories of the wild, wild west kept comin' back to me
He didn't say too much, just tipped his has as he closed the old truck door
And I knew that this trip down Highway 10 would bring me so much more
Where the old man and the little boy could see things eye to eye
He took me back to a place in time where legends never die...
His hands and face were lined and weathered, they told stories of their own
His skin as red as desert clay, his eyes as black as coal
He was a cowboy and an Indian, just a little bit of both
For years of working the ranches and rodeos he didn't have much to show
Then he closed his eyes and spoke to me, his voice was like the wind
And that truck turned into a raging steed so he could ride again
He grabbed the colors from the sky, put them in his hands,
Sprinkled them across the road like grains of colored sand."

I'm just a servant to the silence, the silence I despise
Where in my heart beats a guiding voice?
A sullen hand to suffer my choice
And now, to decipher, the moment's gone

And what has to come to be worth the pain

We'll shred apart array

They will confound your limbs with deadly disease!
Only they will march with you hand in hand
to derail your dreams

of those spluttering saints!
He left them all not resentful but dead!
All alone he came softly up behind

no one heard gloating over the senseless corpse...
He has done this alone

But no one ever knows
how did he strive
showing to demons their ways!

like sacred trees
Give us your life with wisdom of yours!

The fear of reality
Confused creatures created by bizarre pictures
Faces of immortality
Faces of the unknown
Faces of death
The morning face to face
Deceived by beautiful pictures
Killed by crazed thoughts
In gods eye the crime on humanity
Sheer hate before love
The disappointment of gods countenance
The self-mutilation
The destruction of myself
Fear disappears into sweat desire
The dreams of remembrance
The fear of reality
Confused creatures created by bizarre pictures
Faces of immortality

Show me somewhere that I've not been before
You give me so much I don't want anymore
And until I get my fill
Awake on the sea, asleep on the shore
You're making me just want to keep wanting more
I'm understanding, and I'm standing under awe
Just like many, but nobody
Not like any, everybody
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Look at us now
I love it when you say you're better than me
Like you know you're not as clever as me
You can't connect intellectually
And until I get my fill
My head is heading for the head surgery
Everything you said, you heard it from me
Your repetition's just repeating on me
Just like many, but nobody
Not like any, everybody
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Look at us now

[Lyrics: Martin]
People torn to pieces
by the sword of God
They are slaves to christianity
when they drink your blood
The punishment of death
is a soul of torment
Evil and Satan
will win this for them
Bells of misery
Symphonies of hate
Millions of corpses
are showing your fate
Total benediction
Evil masturbation
Gods inqusition
Satans evokation
The beginning of the end
is a terror of darkness
Your body will rot
You can't help them now
The time has come
to unleash the evil
and roasted flesh
is the smell behind us"

Shadows of the night
Wading through the darkness
A death before the light
Blending in with faces
Faces of the night
Safe at home in comfort
At home is where you'll die
Watching you
Knowing your every move
Hearing you
Every single word that you spew
Carving you
Is what I'm about to do
Saving you
From the torment of this earth to be buried for rebirth
Silently I enter through the broken basement window now to wait
It's twelve o'clock the time has come ascend the staircase to the hunted one
Make way to the second floor right outside your open bedroom door
One last time to sleep in peace unaware of brutal things that
Will be done
To you after you awake
Enter slow
Machete leads the way
Eerie calm
Death is in the air
Savage thrust
Death is everywhere
Adrenaline is pumping as my heart is pounding faster yours slows down
Choke on blood and breathe your last breath mangled
Guts I wear to celebrate
Stay inside and fuck the corpse an innards orgy satisfies my needs
Finally I feel complete by eating brains and flesh
Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed
Take what's left in garbage bags and throw them in a hole I dug out back
Clean the room I killed you in making sure the clues of sin are gone
Revel in my vicious deed and replay what had happened in my head
Vivid memories of you remain of your remains
Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed
Followed home then killed"

Places her feet to the floor and slowly stretches out
Her legs take shape and reveal an orange silhouette
Silent she lifts up her hands to light her cigarette
Down right here the silence fades
She moves into the crowd, she evaporates
Down right here the streets all look the same
She moves along, she evaporates
A sea of motion the cars, they flicker in her eyes
Forming odd shapes with the bodies of the passersby
Flowers and curtains, they move so softly in the breeze
How now the wind whispers slow atop her tiny feet
Down right here the silence fades
She moves into the crowd, she evaporates
Down right here the streets all look the same
She moves along, she evaporates
Here in the market the old men smile and sell their goods
These bakers, butchers, and buyers smile as old friends would
She lifts her head and the sun, it flares in orange hues
How now she's moving along against the avenue
Down right here the silence fades
She moves into the crowd, she evaporates
Down right here the streets all look the same
She moves along, she evaporates
Down right here her heart, it quakes
She moves into the crowd, she evaporates
Down right here the streets all look the same
She moves along, she evaporates
Le noir est dtruit par le soleil
Son dos est caress par ses rayons
Elle se promne avec, dans l'avenue
L'tincelle qui a bris la nuit

The darkness is destroyed by the sun
And her back is caressed by it's rays
She strolls with them in the avenue
She is the spark which shattered the night)"

Sleeping in cardboard houses,
Or on the bench in the park
And I can't help but wonder,
Who they really are.
Somebody's father,
Somebody's mom
Somewhere out there with no place to call home
Somebody's brother,
Sombody's sister, Daughter or son,
Somebody's someone.
Matty stands on the corner,
Down the street from my block
Some days I share a dollar,
And some days we talk
She tells me all about her friends,
Who weren't always down on luck
And how they got to where they are today,
Were they all so different then us.

Somebody's mom
Somewhere out there with no place to call home
Somebody's brother,
Sombody's sister, Daughter or son,
